            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>An Introductory DISCOURSE, Containing Mens mistakes about Grace, and their chief happiness, and the true nature of both, with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a gracious person, and the great absurdity of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and cavils he meets with from the World.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of the <hi>Precepts for Christian Practice, &amp;c.</hi> had with his own hand drawn up some other Pieces for the Press, before that weakness seized on his body, which at length made a passage for his soul to a better life. And so they became <hi>Legacies</hi> to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180407:14"/> world, which he left; and being left to my care, lest the witholding of them might render me, as unfaithful to his intentions, so unjust to others, and a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of that good which He, who gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously succeeded his former Treatises, might design to effect by these; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed my self to the payment of them, and that in the order in which they were penned. First, Of that in <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humane Learning, &amp;c.</hi> And since of these which I here present, though later than I intended and endeavoured. He sent towards <hi>London</hi> in the year 1657. about three Sheets concerning the souls communion with Christ (the result of its being married to him) to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his <hi>Considerations concerning Marriage</hi> then coming forth; but they were lost in the way; and he, being destitute of a Copy, was long divided between hopes of finding, and despair of recollecting what was lost; till at length despair of finding it, put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on attempting to recollect it, which produced the Tract of that subject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book. So that some gain hath accrued from that loss, in that this seems larger than the former; and hath
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180407:14"/> also given occasion to the preparing of another, concerning <hi>The Excellency of Grace</hi> (which disposeth for communion with Christ) whereof probably he had entertained no thoughts, if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Papers had not mist their way to the Press; and the new Copy (being no bigger) had not wanted an attendant to walk abroad with it. Nor yet were both likely to take up so much room; but that a Third might well be admitted. Therefore, invited by the <hi>affinity</hi> and no less <hi>utility</hi> of the matter, I have premised an <hi>Abstract</hi> of some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his formerly delivered upon <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.14. touching <hi>Grace;</hi> that seed of God, as it takes <hi>root</hi> in the heart, and <hi>grows</hi> up into the life, and there <hi>flourishes</hi> in profession, and <hi>fructifies</hi> in action. A subject that can not be unseasonable, seeing the <hi>exercise</hi> of Grace is so great a stranger to the lives of the generality of men, that their minds cannot well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the <hi>notion</hi> of it, and they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based the very <hi>name,</hi> by stamping so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other (inferiour) significations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as hath almost obliterated the best. This Title hath been lent to so many things, that now it's much forgot to which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180407:15"/> it most rightly belonged. No commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity hath been more adulterated than Grace, which is no small argument of its great worth. All these following things go for it with some or other, <hi>viz.</hi> A right opinion of divine truths, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral approbation of Gods Wayes, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Gospel-Ordinances, some flashes of conviction, some glances of affection, some fits of good desires, some short Essaies of devout endeavours, an ability in some religious performances, as in Prayer, Preaching, Conference. Some place Grace in <hi>new light,</hi> or knowledge without truth: Others, in a <hi>dark heat</hi> or zeal without knowledge: others in a <hi>luke-warm indifferency,</hi> or discretion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out zeal. Some take up in the <hi>paint</hi> of a <hi>fair,</hi> but <hi>barren profession,</hi> which is but the <hi>colour</hi> of Grace without the <hi>favour:</hi> Others, in the <hi>better</hi> composure of the <hi>outward demeanour,</hi> which is the <hi>favour</hi> of it without the <hi>temper.</hi> Many confine it almost wholly to the <hi>external acts,</hi> either of <hi>devotion,</hi> or of <hi>just dealing,</hi> or of <hi>charity</hi> (of one of these alone, without the other two) and so they make it to be either piety without conscience, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness without rectitude, or benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180407:15"/> without goodness, charity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love either to God or others: Though there want not self-love, that's the Founder of what makes such persons written Benefactors. All is laid out in a purchase of repute and fame, or to make up a Bribe for Divine Justice. Some think <hi>sadness</hi> is the only <hi>goodness,</hi> and that no <hi>affection</hi> is so truly <hi>religious</hi> as the <hi>hypochondriacal.</hi> Others take <hi>joy and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> for it, reckoning that the <hi>heart</hi> should have no <hi>motion</hi> but <hi>exultation.</hi> Some place it in a being <hi>better</hi> than such as are very <hi>bad:</hi> Others, in <hi>associating</hi> with those that are accounted <hi>good,</hi> or in their <hi>adhering</hi> to a certain <hi>party,</hi> which is but to make themselves <hi>Ciphers</hi> of <hi>no value</hi> alone, and such as can <hi>go for nothing</hi> in Religion, if not added to such or such a <hi>number</hi> of men.</p>
                  <p>Further, since wild fancies have run such <hi>division</hi> upon the <hi>grounds</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, how have <hi>backfalls</hi> and <hi>elevations</hi> gone for <hi>Graces</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> as well as in <hi>Musick?</hi> How hath <hi>piety</hi> exchanged <hi>notes</hi> with <hi>melody?</hi> Whilest many, rejecting the <hi>better way,</hi> have set it by <hi>Crotchets</hi> and <hi>Quavers,</hi> and <hi>tuned</hi> it into such <hi>Aiery</hi> Strains, such odd <hi>Coranto's,</hi> as only Satans
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180407:16"/>
                     <hi>Wind-instruments,</hi> the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires and playes upon, are fitted to express.</p>
                  <p>Thus variously hath the name of Grace been applyed with reference to Religion. It hath other acceptions of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>aspect,</hi> and that reputed not by the fewest and the most <hi>benign.</hi> Who care for no other Grace than what Gold may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to find, or which advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entitles to; or who are chiefly for those <hi>Graces</hi> which may present their senses with some delight: Whether they be those <hi>hogo's</hi> which <hi>flatter</hi> the <hi>taste,</hi> those amiable <hi>features</hi> which sparkle in the <hi>countenance,</hi> that rhetorical <hi>spruseness</hi> that <hi>embellisheth</hi> the <hi>Speech,</hi> the sweet and curious <hi>accents</hi> that <hi>rellish</hi> the <hi>Voice,</hi> or other musical sounds, or those elegant <hi>gestures</hi> and plausible modes of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>adorn</hi> the <hi>carriage.</hi> Give them these <hi>Graces,</hi> and for the <hi>Graces of the Spirit,</hi> let those take them who can fancy them, or who can conceit the praise of God to be better than the praise of men. Yea, there is a Generation, with whom (as if it were their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to shew at how dreadful a height of provocation, it is possible for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180407:16"/> of <hi>Adam</hi> to arrive) it hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced</hi> no small <hi>degree</hi> of Excellency, to be able to swear, lye, cheat; to be lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, intemperate, impudent; yea, to practise the most excessive <hi>debaucheries with a good grace.</hi> And so the <hi>flesh</hi> hath got its <hi>Graces</hi> as well as the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and there are <hi>hellish</hi> Graces as well as <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> While it's become an ingenious thing to be wicked at a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rate; and thought worthy of mean applause to invent unusual strains of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and be <hi>vile beyond the common reach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have men brought down the price of that excellent quality Grace, by rendring its name so exceeding cheap, and prostituting it to so many things, that the one, to which it properly belonged, is usually overlookt and lost in a crowd. But if any desire to know the true and genuine <hi>notion</hi> of Grace, as it is an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent qualification of the soul, let them take it in the following account. It is a Divine habit implanted in the soul ever inclining it to act suitably to some Divine Rule. It is a principle of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life and action, the issue of Gods free Grace, and the pledge and infancy of Glory. The spring of all motion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180407:17"/> Heaven-ward. A supernatural biass car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the soul to its chiefest good. A frame and temper of heart constantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing and prompting the man to a compliance with Gods will. It is such a resemblance of Divinity, as the Scripture styles a participation of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It's Gods comeliness put upon the soul. An umbrage or shadow of his perfections. A second draught of his Image which sin had defaced. A new impression of his Law upon the heart. Integrity of a later Edition (with this addition of perpetuity) but unfinisht, being still to receive further sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements till death compleat it and set on <hi>Finis.</hi> It's the <hi>soul</hi> of Religion, the <hi>life</hi> of the soul, the <hi>spring</hi> of life, the <hi>nether</hi>-spring (for Christ is the <hi>upper</hi>) which hath its <hi>rise</hi> from the great <hi>deep</hi> of infinite goodness, and <hi>runs</hi> into the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Eternity. It's often called <hi>living water,</hi> or <hi>water of life;</hi> and well it may, for all the faculties of the inward man were brought into a deadly <hi>swoon</hi> by the <hi>fall,</hi> out of which this is the only <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> or Water of Life that can recover them, and make the man come to himself, cure all his spiritual distempers, give
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180407:17"/> health, strength and beauty to his soul, and make him long-lived, even to live for ever. A fuller and distincter account of it may be collected from this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Character of a gracious Person,</hi> which all who would love and credit Grace should labour to make their own. He is one that is endued with Divine Graces, and lives in the exercise of them. He hath the <hi>work of Grace</hi> for his <hi>principle,</hi> the <hi>Word of Grace</hi> for his <hi>rule,</hi> and the <hi>God of Grace</hi> for his <hi>end;</hi> from whom as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, so to him he refers whatever of good he either is, hath or doth. It's his care to please God, and his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to honour him, as it is his happiness to enjoy him. No other enjoyment can deliver any such endearment to his love, such satisfaction to his desire, such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to his delight, such ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his joy. Here he fixes his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est esteem, his humblest reverence, his dearest affections, his freest choice, his firmest trust, his most insatiable longings, his sweetest thoughts, intentest looks, incessant praises, and entirest complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He follows him close, in that new and living way which his Saviour hath made for him, for the beams of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180407:18"/> light, the tokens of his love, the tasts of his goodness, the views of his beauty, a livelier sense of his attributes, the seal and conduct of his Spirit, deeper impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his truth, fairer signatures of his holiness, further degrees of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his nature and will, the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of pardon, peace, joy; of life, strength, vigour; of support, enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, establishment; and for a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suitably and chearfully to comply with his injunctions and dispensations. He strives to live under a constant sense of God; takes all opportunities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him, and can neither be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Mercies, Ordinances, nor du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, except he enjoy God in all. Yea, he lives upon him, and that not only in reference to his spiritual, but temporal life. He depends on him for the gift of what he wants, and the good of what he hath; for the benefit of his advantages, the maintaining of his maintenance, the comfort of his comforts, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his crosses. He casts his burden and his care on the Lord, commits his way and work to him, and humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his desires, enjoyments, undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and himself to his dispose. If God
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180407:18"/> be absent, it's not in the power of any delight to rescue him from disconsolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. If he go, no enjoyment can make contentment stay behind. But when God is present, he can spare other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts (if they be called for) and yet abate nothing of his joy. Yea, this can flow the highest when they are at the lowest ebb. For in God are the <hi>fresh springs</hi> of all that <hi>sweetness,</hi> which is but sprinkled in slenderer <hi>drops</hi> throughout the whole Creation. In him is the summ total of all those excellencies, whereof we meet but with some smaller items in these lower things. Therefore he can by his own immediate communications make a rich amends for the loss of any temporal concernments, and deliver the gracious person from the want of them, even while they are wanting. Let him but keep his hold of God, and enjoy his quickning and chearing influences, and then let troubles do their worst they cannot make him miserable. Yea, he hath so much as may suffice to make Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Mannors, Scepters, and all those loud names which the world admires, fall below his envy. He values God above all, and other things at that rate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180407:19"/> which God hath set upon them. And that which gives any thing the greatest price with him, is not its fitness to serve upon the designs of any lust, or gratifie any sensual desire, but the relation it bears to the Supream Good, as it carries either some resemblance of Gods excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, an instance of his bounty, or some reference to his glory. As for himself, he reckons that he is worth so much only as he is rich towards God, and enjoyes of him. He is sensible it's the highest priviledge and accomplishment of his nature to be like him, and therefore takes the pattern of his apprehensions from Divine Wisdom, the aim of his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations from the divine pleasure, the object of his affections from divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the measure of his actions from divine prescriptions. He will not lend his credence in spiritual matters, but where Divine Authority engages for his security. He must have Gods <hi>Word</hi> for what he <hi>believes,</hi> Gods <hi>Warrant</hi> for what he <hi>acts,</hi> and Gods <hi>promise</hi> for what he <hi>expects.</hi> And he is carefull so well to understand the ground he goes on, as that he may not hugg his own or others conceits, inventions or presumptions for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180407:19"/> Gods truths, precepts, or promises. And as to the last, he looks at it as ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his unworthiness to prescribe to infinite bounty, and set God a time or way of performance, where his word hath set none. Since he can challenge nothing from God, he will promise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self nothing any further than God gives him ground to look for it, lest his hopes being only provided for a shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter journey, should run themselves out of breath long before the blessing be within sight, and lose it for want of tarrying for it, or by seeking it in a wrong way. He remembers he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, makes not haste, and strives that his faith may not be too quick for his obedience, nor his sins too great for his hopes. He minds Gods condition, while he would have God mend his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; is careful of performing what God requires, whilest he expects Gods perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what he promises; knowing that great expectations joyn'd with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle preparation, do but clog the wheels of mercy, by the filth they leave in its way, and so make it long a coming. He makes account that common mercies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a more than common thankfulness,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180407:20"/> and cannot think (though it be usual with men to carry, as if they thought so) that he <hi>owes the less</hi> for any blessing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>receives the more</hi> of it. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges himself less than the <hi>least</hi> of all Gods mercies, yet cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any that are short of the <hi>greatest.</hi> He thinks <hi>well</hi> of God, when he deals the <hi>worst</hi> with him; and <hi>ill</hi> of himself, when he doth the <hi>best.</hi> He will not make God the Author of his guilt, nor himself the Author of Gods gifts. He will not <hi>lessen</hi> Gods <hi>Justice,</hi> to <hi>magnifie</hi> his <hi>Mercy,</hi> nor <hi>wrong</hi> his <hi>Holiness,</hi> while he seeks to do <hi>right</hi> to his <hi>free Grace.</hi> His reverence will not suffer him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nor his gratitude to desire that God should blot out his sins and his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty together. And as it is much more becoming of God to give, so it would be more acceptable to him to receive power to leave sin, than leave to live in it,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.3.</note> and ability to answer his obligations than a liberty annulling them. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks himself good enough, though the Scripture give him the style of an excellent one; <hi>The righteous is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12.26. For there is no one so much <hi>a Creature, a man and a Christian</hi> as he.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:180407:20"/>I. <hi>He is most Gods Creature</hi> of any in the Creation. For he was twice created, once as of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and again, as in the second, whence he is called <hi>a new Creature.</hi> And this second Creation doth as really (and by more noble endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) distinguish him from other men who are unrenewed, as the first doth both him and them from inferiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He is <hi>Gods Workmanship,</hi> his master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, a curious and costly piece, upon which he hath laid out the treasures of his wisdom, the greatness of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the exceeding riches of his Grace, in which he hath exprest most of himself, and where he hath pourtrayed his own life, his Sons death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and inlaid his Spirits fruits and operations.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>He is most a man</hi> of any in the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because he lives at the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from a brutish life, suffers not the brute to ride the man in him, doth not put the curb into the mouth of reason, and let his sensitive appetite mannage the reins. He knows what he is, and would not live below himself, nor have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation disparage his constitution, nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180407:21"/> his resentments too low for his shape. He is not ignorant which is his better part, and thinks it not fit it should have the worse usage, and be employed in the drudgery of that which is of so much an inferiour alloy. He cannot endure that his soul, which is of so high an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Royal Stock of Heaven, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to Divinity, should be prostituted to the lusts of the flesh, and only serve upon the designs of the body, which ows its Original to the basest of beings, the very earth we tread on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because he most agrees with the original pattern of Humane Nature, and the first draught of it in <hi>Adam,</hi> as being conformed to the likeness of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Wisdom, Righteousness and true holiness; and most conversing with those objects, to the contemplation and prosecution, the apprehension and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, his principal faculties were designed and fitted, God and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual matters, the great things of a better life. So that his powers have their most proper and perfective employment, and not only the higher, but the lower too; these being in him better regulated than in others.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:180407:21"/>3. Because he is most rational. For he lives in the constant and best use of his reason, and hath it much improved by Divine Revelation in the Word, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination by the Spirit. And while he observes Gods commands (which he doth most) he acts according to the dictates of the highest reason, even of Infinite Wisdom. It's he who in Scripture language is the <hi>Wise man</hi> (and most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with <hi>Solomon,</hi> who will not suffer the wicked man and a fool to be two) for he hath the best and most useful knowledge, and he makes the best use of it. He knows what is most worthy and requisite to be known, as God, Christ, and himself; the Nature, Will and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God; the excellency, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and benefits of Christ; the save<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts and influences of the Holy Ghost; the state of his own soul, the temper of his Spirit, and the tendency of his course; his duty and interest; his highest end, his chiefest good, his true happiness, and the only means to attain it; the best helps to good, and the best remedies against evil; yea, how (by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of those promises, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.) to make the <hi>best</hi> of the

He understands those things which the natural man (not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Grace) cannot apprehend, nor can it enter into his heart to conceive them, <hi>The hidden Wisdom, the deep things of God, those which he hath prepared for them that love him, things spiritual, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, eternal; the unsearchable riches, the surpassing love of Christ,</hi> the sweetness of divine attributes, promises, presence; of relation to, and communion with him; of doing what he requires, and of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering what he calls to.

He highly prizes the Means, of Grace and Salvation, and endeavours to improve them to the utmost.

                     <hi>and of that which is to come. He who seeks first Gods Kingdom and his righteousness, shall have other things added to him.</hi> He is careful as to banish those lusts which do by a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence prejudice the body (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness which dishonours it; intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance which diseases it, envy, anxious cares and fears which macerate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet it.) So to avoid all sin in general, which renders the body obnoxious to misery both temporal and eternal. He offers it up to God, and so engages his care of it, dedicates it for a Temple of the Holy Ghost, and so gets every thing sanctified that relates to it, a blessing upon what ever concerns it, and takes a sure course to render the <hi>second state</hi> of this <hi>Temple</hi> (when it shall be raised up again out of the ruines death shall make) abundantly <hi>more glorious</hi> than the <hi>first</hi> could be, though it were accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Glories that any where shine in mortal eye. Well therefore may He be thus in short described, that He is one, who understands what <hi>he is,</hi> endeavours to be what <hi>he should be,</hi> and alone attains to what all men <hi>desire to be,</hi> to be happy. For he, considering that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180407:25"/> since our first Parents changed a <hi>real</hi> for an <hi>imaginary</hi> felicity, their off-spring have cheated, and yet pleased themselves with the shadows and images, the dreams and fancies of happiness, is careful not to share in their mistakes, or those inventions of happiness they have found out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lose both God and themselves. He is not so imprudent as to place his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good in those things which owe most of that goodness to which they are valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to their own nature or inherent excellencies, but to the opinions and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of men, and therefore are liable to forfeit it when ever their humours shall alter, which is the case of Fashions, Sports, Pleasures, Honour, Applause, and those external niceties which are made the formal differences of men in this state. He looks upon those temporal things that are the fullest of good, as not able to hold much; <hi>that which they are not,</hi> being so exceedingly more than <hi>what they are:</hi> and how great soever they are <hi>in expectation,</hi> they are much less <hi>in fruition.</hi> Those that look biggest are hollow within. His <hi>Divinity</hi> cannot but approve of that <hi>Philosophy</hi> that makes <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidum &amp; vacuum,</hi> solidity and vacuity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180407:26"/> the Elements of the world. For he still finds those things that make the <hi>most shew</hi> and the <hi>greatest noise</hi> in the world, to be most empty, and have least in them. He sees the splendour of those things that glitter here below, to deal often with mens hopes, as the bright Sun with their flowers; first it calls them forth, and makes them spread, and then causes them to wither and shrivel up. And so not unusually the greatest expectations end in the greatest disappointments. He could not reckon himself <hi>happy</hi> in those <hi>accommodations,</hi> which are themselves so <hi>unhappy</hi> as to be <hi>embased</hi> with great <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> and those sometimes so great, as that all the good in them is not able to recompence them. So great Estates and great places, are attended with great cares and troubles, fears and snares, and sometimes bring men into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of offendors, and make them lose their lives, and therewith all they have. Nor can he set the highest rate upon those delights wherewith he may much sooner <hi>surfeit,</hi> than be <hi>satisfied.</hi> He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves those things which <hi>please</hi> mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to be still allayed with something <hi>unpleasing,</hi> which often by means of what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180407:26"/> they carry off acceptable, insinuates it self to their great hurt; and looks upon the matter of disgust (the ingrateful mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) as contrived into them for a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some check of mens fondness of them. He takes notice that the same means which are used to <hi>prolong life</hi> (though the draughts and morsels be never so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious) do usually <hi>hasten death.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is most ordinarily from their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et (as storing up matter of diseases) that men dye. He finds a tiresomness even in recreation, and that loud laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter takes its farewell in a deep sigh; and is told,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.13.</note> that <hi>even in it the heart may be sorrowful.</hi> And if he be studious, he beholds the most curious speculations of the mind, enquiring into the hidden cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of things ever perplexed with <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> often dasht with <hi>uncertainties,</hi> patched with <hi>conjectures,</hi> and then painted with <hi>confidence</hi> to set them off. He sees with what imperfections they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and with what pangs brought forth; and how many times a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception serves but to disgrace another which was formerly applauded, and yet may it self possibly hold its repute no longer than till a third come to throw
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180407:27"/> it down: and that their highest: attempts leave much even among the lowest things that is able to pose and baffle them. He further observes the most of these temporal enjoyments to be fade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flitting, exposed to internal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes and external violence: the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of them not to be long-lived: yea, the finest delights to be most brittle, and the <hi>best</hi> to grow worse with keeping. That the Elegancies of taste, those deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies which are wont to take with the most judicious palats, soon become stale and unsavoury. That those flowers which seem wholly composed of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and sweetness will quickly send forth a rank scent, and wither in your hand; or if not pluckt, will after a while find a <hi>grave</hi> where they had a <hi>womb:</hi> And so, that the most amiable complexion (how ever prided in by some, and adored by others) may on a suddain lose its vigour and sprightfulness, and put on a sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hew. And if its beauty be not rubbed off by some harsh accident, it will certainly wear off with age; but often it doth more early become the prey of some <hi>disease,</hi> which may leave no <hi>memorial</hi> of it, save only the <hi>pits</hi> in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180407:27"/> which it was buried; or an <hi>Epitaph</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with arrs.</p>
                  <p>He discerns this blemish in all <hi>worldly glory,</hi> that it is <hi>flashy</hi> and <hi>soon extinct:</hi> this unhappiness inseparable from all earthly felicity, that it's frail and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. That the most pleasing <hi>harmony</hi> of bodily parts is soonest out of <hi>tune.</hi> That the most dazzling <hi>splendour</hi> may on a suddain be <hi>arrested</hi> with a <hi>cloud. That a man being in honour abides not.</hi> That the <hi>situation</hi> of <hi>greatness</hi> is in the <hi>suburbs</hi> of <hi>ruine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 23.5.</note> That <hi>riches certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make themselves wings,</hi> and do but rarely love to build their <hi>nests</hi> long in the same <hi>house.</hi> That an enemy, a thief, an unfaithful servant, a fire, or other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty, if not the owners prodigality, doth not unfrequently give them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for a flight. That Friends may either lose their <hi>lives,</hi> or their <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi> or if their <hi>amity</hi> continue, their <hi>ability</hi> may fail; or if that remain, yet we may many wayes be hindered of their company or assistance.</p>
                  <p>He knows that the things of the world cannot reach his noblest part, being of a nature so exceedingly inferiour and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable thereto, and so no more able to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180407:28"/> put it into a better state, to give it its highest accomplishment and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than Brass is, by its addition, to render Gold more valuable, or of a finer temper. He knows all the <hi>pleasures</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun cannot secure it from the anguish of Gods <hi>displeasure:</hi> nor all the <hi>Gold</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> suffice to make a <hi>cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> against its faintings, or to <hi>buy a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or <hi>hire a Mansion</hi> in Heaven, no nor to <hi>bribe conscience</hi> on earth, when God will make it speak. That all the <hi>breath of fame</hi> cannot <hi>inspire</hi> it with spiritual <hi>life,</hi> nor <hi>speak</hi> one prevailing <hi>word</hi> to God for it: And that the <hi>highest titles</hi> are insufficient to procure the <hi>lowest place</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven. Yea, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands, that worldly things are so far from delivering a happiness to that part which properly makes the man, that they render its escape of misery much more difficult, by multiplying temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to pride, intemperance, oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, earthly-mindedness, disregard of God, <hi>&amp;c. They that will be rich</hi> (that make it their main design to be so, and pursue it with all their might) <hi>fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180407:28"/> in destruction and perdition, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. Hence it is that our Saviour saith, <hi>Verily, a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; It is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, Matth.</hi> 19.23, 24. Such a one for the most part is led away from God and true blessedness in chains of Gold and Silver; and so the estate of the inward man is often the worst, when that of the outward is at the best. Receiving <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of men hindered many of the Jews from receiving Christ by faith,<note place="margin">Joh. 5 44. 1 Tim. 5 6.</note> and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ. Such as live in <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> are dead while they live. Their bodies are only the Sepulchres of their fouls▪ Too much conversing with these lower things makes the finest Spirits sink below themselves, and by being dearly immerst in the designs of preferment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, pleasure, they lose much of their nobler mettall.</p>
                  <p>And though temporal things do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the interests of the body, yet the judicious Christian considers, that they at the utmost only accompany it to the Grave, and there take their leave (the <hi>house of Eternity</hi> having no <hi>dining-room,</hi> wherein the rich Gluttons Table
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180407:29"/> should be furnished, no place of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the voluptuous, no Throne for the Prince) yea, that their usefulness is many times as unable to extend to all the parts and conditions of this life, as to reach beyond it. While the power of an adversary, or of a disease, an acute pain, or the sense of guilt may turn them into specious uncertainties, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate names. Now he cannot expect to be happy by things that carry so great a disproportion to his nature, and fall so exceeding short of it in duration; as being sure to forsake him at death, and not unlikely to do it before; and so he must be without them ten thousand times longer than he can possess them; yea, he must want them above so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Ages</hi> as he enjoyes them <hi>Minutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, He finds nothing here below that can terminate mens desires, but sees them restless and ever travelling in the pursuit of something wherein they may acquiesce, yet in vain. For while they are posting up and down through all the stages of contentment, and ever and anon baiting on some comfort or other, yet they are so far from satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and rest, as that they are but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180407:29"/> refreshed for a further journey. They are still pursuing what flyes from them, and gain no more by their long travell, than in the latter end thereof to be as far to seek for happiness, as they were at first setting out. How usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al is it for men to think, if they had but such an Estate, Dignity, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, such a measure of knowledge, such conveniencies or advantages, they would quietly sit down and say, <hi>it is enough?</hi> But when by a very eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit (and it may be so great a haste as did not permit them to call on God by the way) they are become Masters of their wishes, they are as great strangers to solid contentment as before; and their desires are not quenched but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by enjoyment, and will not be fed at so low a rate as formerly, but require something higher and greater. For mens desires are usually modestest at first, and grow wider by being fulfilled. The <hi>grant</hi> of one thing, teaches them to <hi>want</hi> another, and that something beyond, or at least different from what they had. Thus they endeavour to supply &amp; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the weakness &amp; insufficiency of single enjoyments, by the multiplicity and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180407:30"/> of them. But all will not do. They will easily weary, disappoint and vex them,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.8. &amp; 5.10.</note> but not satisfie them. <hi>The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing: He that loves Silver shall not be satisfied with Silver, nor he that loves abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with increase. Discontent</hi> may raise the greatest <hi>tumult</hi> in a <hi>throng</hi> of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>contentments,</hi> which is evident in the cases of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> all whose dignities, pomp, possessions, delights, could not recompence the dissatisfaction which the denyal of a <hi>Vineyard</hi> gave the one, and but of a <hi>complement</hi> the other. These things considered, the wise Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cannot but reckon, that those do with an unaccountable prodigality throw away their desires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, who seek for satisfaction and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in any thing short of God recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in his Son. In whom only he looks for it, and is sure not to miss of it. Whatsoever of worth is in the Creatures being but a faint <hi>shadow</hi> of some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in God, he will not neglect the <hi>substance</hi> for it. For he knows there is nothing fit to answer a comparison with God for goodness, who enjoyes it ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and essentially, absolutely and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180407:30"/> infinitely, and is the overflowing fountain of what ever excellency recommends any other thing to our esteem. In him good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is free from the least alloy or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, from all decay and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unconfined to any place, time, or state, extending to all the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of the outward and inward man, and running parallel, not only to this life, but with that endless one to come. <hi>He</hi> only is the proper object of the soul, that Spiritual and immortal Being, who <hi>suits</hi> its nature, as he is a <hi>Spirit; equals</hi> its duration, as <hi>eternal;</hi> can <hi>replenish</hi> its capacities, as <hi>immense; satisfie</hi> its desires, as <hi>all-sufficient; perfect</hi> and <hi>ennoble</hi> all its <hi>faculties;</hi> the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> with boundless <hi>wisdom,</hi> the <hi>will</hi> with glorious <hi>goodness,</hi> the affections with the most lovely and ravishing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. He is such an object as leaves nothing higher or better to be desired or imagined,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.21, 22, 23. <hi>All things are yours, if you be Christs;</hi> and so God be yours, and you shall have all things that will be for your best good, else they are not desirable</note> and can never be enjoyed, so much, as not to invite to, and abundantly more than suffice for a further (a never ceasing, and yet never cloying) fruition. Yea, such an one as gives a title to all other requisite good
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180407:31"/> things, to those who have an interest in him; and can give, as them, so a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon them; and if they be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, can croud a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort into a little of the creature; can make a single Dish outvie a Feast, the meanest fare be much more delicious than the profusest entertainment, and a small stock go farther with his blessing than large revenues without it. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked, Psal.</hi> 37.16. Where the <hi>possessions</hi> are lower, God can heighten the <hi>fruition:</hi> or if he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be taken away, he can him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be instead of them: He will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of all things in Heaven, and was for meat and drink to <hi>Moses</hi> while he was in the Mount forty dayes and nights,<note place="margin">Ex 34.28.</note> and can by himself (if it be needful) make up the want of those, or other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations to other of his servants here on earth. Therefore he hath taken upon himself the names of all other comforts, to intimate that he is able to stand for all that they signifie, or are worth. So he is stiled, <hi>a portion, inheritance, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, high-tower, shield, shade, strength, a deliverer, a friend, a Father, a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180407:31"/> &amp;c.</hi> He who is <hi>Author,</hi> can easily be <hi>instar omnium:</hi> What ever benefit and helpfulness we meet with in other things, is to be found in God in a higher and more excellent manner. Therefore if he give in the more of himself upon the withdrawing of some temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the gracious soul will have no more reason to complain for want of comfort, than he hath for want of light, when instead of the Stars the Sun rises upon him.</p>
                  <p>Let these things be well weighed, and then say whether the good mans choice of happiness be not incomparably the best, and whether any therein act so rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, as he who ever breaths after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the source of all goodness.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>He is most a Christian</hi> of any in the Church: He only possesses what the far greatest part of the Christian world esteems it sufficient to pretend to. While others <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> he alone <hi>enjoyes</hi> the <hi>thing;</hi> and is as much as they are content to say they are, or to seem to be. Though never so many lay <hi>claim</hi> to the same <hi>title,</hi> yet he hath the <hi>best deeds</hi> to shew for it. Others may have the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phrases</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180407:32"/> but he hath the <hi>sense.</hi> They may be good <hi>Linguists</hi> in Divinity, but he is the <hi>Artist.</hi> He is a <hi>vessel</hi> both of mercy and honour, <hi>washt</hi> not only on the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> by water in Baptism, but <hi>within</hi> too by the washing of regeneration. He hath not only given up his name, but his heart to Christianity, and <hi>maintains</hi> it not only by the <hi>labour</hi> of his <hi>lips,</hi> but by the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>hands,</hi> and the <hi>course</hi> of his <hi>life.</hi> He humbly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully takes Christ for his Prophet, Priest and King, his Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires his love, presses after intimacy with him, lives upon his fulness, and daily by <hi>faith</hi> fetches from <hi>him</hi> what he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and by <hi>obedience</hi> observes what he commands. He hath <hi>Christs name</hi> in his <hi>mouth,</hi> his <hi>truth</hi> in his <hi>mind,</hi> his <hi>life</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> and his <hi>example</hi> in his <hi>life.</hi> Though none lay out so <hi>high a care</hi> in the doing of <hi>goodworks,</hi> yet none set so <hi>low a rate</hi> on them when done. Though he be the most <hi>faithful</hi> servant in Christs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet he is the most <hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> in his own. And though no other man be so much <hi>Christs servant,</hi> yet neither is any one so much his <hi>own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180407:32"/> Master.</hi> For while he is at Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, his affections and lusts are at his own. He values Divine Truths not so much for the satisfaction they offer to his mind, as for that practical influence they may derive upon his heart and life. He endeavours that the <hi>light</hi> which shines in the word, may not only <hi>irradiate</hi> his understanding, but <hi>inflame</hi> his affections, and be so <hi>reflected</hi> by his practice into the eyes of others, that they may <hi>see</hi> their duty, and the way to Heaven thereby. Many <hi>boast</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> but he only is <hi>born</hi> to it; he is a <hi>child of light,</hi> and heir to an <hi>inheritance in light.</hi> The light of many may be but like that of a <hi>Torch,</hi> which <hi>lights</hi> one that's dead to his <hi>long home.</hi> But his is the <hi>light of life;</hi> not only a glittering, but a glowing light. It <hi>rayes</hi> in his <hi>mind,</hi> and makes it by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>reflections mount</hi> upwards, and aspire to the <hi>Father of lights:</hi> It <hi>flames</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> and turns the whole man into a <hi>living Sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> It <hi>shines</hi> in his <hi>life,</hi> adorning the Gospel, and giving others occasion to glorifie God. His is the most <hi>noble Spirit;</hi> For its raised <hi>above</hi> these inferiour things; most affects the best <hi>company,</hi> even that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180407:33"/> of God himself; and that <hi>honour</hi> which it is as much beyond the power of man to take away, as to give, that of being a <hi>Favourite,</hi> yea, a <hi>Son</hi> to the <hi>Most High.</hi> His chief <hi>attempts</hi> aim no lower than <hi>Heaven,</hi> whither he strives to carry as great a retinue as he can. His inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are publick; he designs others good as well as his own; and he disdains to accept of whatever Temptation would offer to <hi>bribe</hi> him from his duty. He hath the <hi>best spiritual estate,</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> at a <hi>higher rate</hi> than others; yet hath he <hi>low thoughts</hi> of himself. He is the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est examiner, the freest accuser, and the severest censurer of himself; and so both prevents Gods sentence, and is disposed to charitable thoughts of others; (especially as to those actions which may be either good or bad, according to the different circumstances, motives or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of them, and so may to another that is not acquainted with these, have the same aspect, when good as when bad) lest making a wrong judgement of them, he bring judgement on himself, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1, 2. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>tears</hi> of true <hi>repentance</hi> are <hi>distilled</hi> not so much by applying the <hi>fire of Hell,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:180407:33"/> as by a more kindly <hi>warmth of love</hi> to God and goodness enkindled from above. He is grieved for the unworthiness and disingenuity of his carriage to him, to whom a better was by so many obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions due. He sees too much <hi>evil</hi> in <hi>sin</hi> to be beholding to it for any <hi>good</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, or to excuse him from any evil he fears; for he knows no evil so great as it. Suffering is not, for that only reaches to his body, and determines with this life. But sin strikes at his soul too, and at God; and its pernitious influence lasts to eternal ages. He accounts <hi>no sin lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi> since the least is so big as to oppose the Will, slight the Authority, and break the Commands of an Infinite Deity. When Temptation tells him any sin is but a <hi>little one,</hi> it offers him an argument against it self. For he reckons it most unmeet and unwise to offend a Great and a Good God for a small matter, and sell Divine favour and inward peace (which ought to be the dearest to him) so very cheap: A little sin if allowed, he knows will soon open a way for a greater, and make no little havock upon conscience. He cares not for walking on the edge of his liberty, lest he sometimes trespass
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:180407:34"/> upon the Devils ground; lest his foot slip, and he fall into Iniquity. He would not invite a miscarriage, by making choice of bad company, and venturing on the occasions of sin. For this were to give <hi>Temptation</hi> a <hi>Challenge,</hi> when his own <hi>corruption</hi> would be too ready to be its <hi>second,</hi> and his rashness forfeiting Divine Assistance, might expose him to the wo of him who is alone. He remembers that <hi>Evil converse</hi> (meetings or familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) <hi>corrupt good manners;</hi> draw first to a <hi>neglect</hi> of duty,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.33. <hi>Colloquia</hi> is too strait a rendring of <gap reason="foreign">

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bending to a compliance with evil companions, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy will break. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be love and agreement without some likeness and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of inclinations and actions. He also considers the admonition in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Turn away from such as having a form of godliness deny the power thereof;</hi> and sees reason to suspect, that a frequent and unnecessary society with such, will abate the power of it in himself. For what remains of the old weight of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180407:34"/> may, with the addition of theirs, draw him down by degrees to remisness. He therefore chooses such for his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friends as may give him a <hi>lift</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and not a <hi>pull-back, Prov.</hi> 13.20.</p>
                  <p>It's his wisdom not to <hi>parley</hi> with a temptation, knowing what it cost <hi>Eve,</hi> though in the state of integrity. And knowing that it cannot take him but by surrender; that the Tempter cannot hurt him without his own leave, he is continually fetching in the aid of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fortifie his resolutions, and make a stiff resistance, which will put Satan to flight; who can get no hold of him so long as he with-holds his consent. He looks upon worldly pleasures and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not as they <hi>come on the Stage</hi> to <hi>act</hi> their <hi>parts,</hi> but as they <hi>go off,</hi> and sees the <hi>farewell</hi> of <hi>afflictions,</hi> when sanctified, so much better than <hi>that</hi> of sinful <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> that he cannot but account the <hi>assaults</hi> of the former <hi>less formidable</hi> than the <hi>addresses</hi> of the latter: and can be better reconciled to, the <hi>severities</hi> of the one, than the <hi>caresses</hi> and courtship of the other. He would not disgust divine dispensations, not quarrel with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180407:35"/> his allowance as too small, nor with his grievances as too great. Considering that he hath <hi>not worth enough</hi> to be the <hi>price</hi> of the least blessing; nor <hi>unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness little enough</hi> to make the <hi>greatest pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure overweight:</hi> And that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised not to lay on so much as to <hi>oppress</hi> his <hi>patience;</hi> and doth never leave him too little to <hi>maintain</hi> his <hi>thankfulness;</hi> and that the most unpleasant Cup God puts into his hand to drink, is of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies tempering; which can <hi>distill sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for him out of the <hi>waters of Marah,</hi> and <hi>extract</hi> an <hi>excellent Spirit</hi> from <hi>Gall and wormwood:</hi> and if he be cut short of lower accommodations, it shall be but to starve his lust; his Graces shall thrive the more: and what evils assault him, shall forfeit their malignity and turn good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>The Ark of the Covenant</hi> is a fit resemblance of him, as in whom are <hi>laid up</hi> both the <hi>tables of it,</hi> and hidden <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> by them, and Gods <hi>rod blossoming and bringing forth the peaceable fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> His <hi>patience</hi> bestows a <hi>beauty</hi> upon <hi>adversity,</hi> and gives a pleasing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to the most unpleasing accidents.

                  </p>
                  <p>None so <hi>fearful</hi> as the good man of <hi>doing evil,</hi> and yet none more <hi>valiant</hi> in <hi>enduring</hi> it.

He counts that a bad <hi>stomach,</hi> which cannot <hi>digest</hi> any thing <hi>hard</hi> or <hi>harsh,</hi> without turning it into <hi>ill blood. With soft answers he turns away wrath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 15.1.</note> and forbears <hi>grievous words,</hi> because <hi>they stir up anger,</hi> and strife, the least <hi>spark</hi> of which he would not <hi>blow up</hi> by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking breath, much less would he seek abroad for fuel to <hi>feed</hi> it, or listen to <hi>tale-bearers</hi> (a Generation forbidden, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16. As are also <hi>tatlers</hi> and <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie-bodies,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13.) For where no Wood is, the fire goes out, so where there is no tale-bearer, the strife ceases.

This is earthly, sensual, devilish, and contrary to the wisdom which descendeth from above; for that is first pure, and then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be intreated (or perswaded) full of mercy and good fruits, &amp;c. James</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. He who hath a right Spirit within him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that anger rests in the bosom of fools,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.26, 27.</note> and that the Devil lodges in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:180407:36"/> bosome of angry persons, who let the Sun go down on their wrath: and that malice renders men very <hi>unlike God</hi> who <hi>is love,</hi> and so like the Devil as to be his pictures, his children.<note place="margin">Joh 8 40. James 3.8. &amp; 1.26.</note> He considers the <hi>tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and that <hi>who so bridles it not, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain. He therefore renders not evil for evil, not reviling for reviling, but blessing,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. He will go back from his right considerably, to make way for peace and friendship; and though wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will not count it unbeseeming him to imitate his Heavenly Father in first seeking to the party which did the wrong, to be reconciled to him. He will not disdain to stoop very low to take up a difference, when he considers how Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath stooped to Earth, the holy and glorious God to sinful dust, and that he is commanded to be merciful, as his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is merciful, and <hi>to forgive</hi> (even <hi>till seventy seven times,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6 14, 15. &amp; 18.21, 22.</note> if any one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him so oft) if he would <hi>be forgiven;</hi> and to <hi>pray without wrath,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. And that else he shall but curse himself with the heaviest curse when ever he prayes, that <hi>God would forgive him his trespasses, as he forgives those who trespass
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180407:37"/> against him,</hi> that is, not forgive them at all; and shall be liable to <hi>judgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, for not shewing mercy.</hi> Then he thinks of his proneness to errors, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, indiscretions, which may need others pardon, as well as theirs his: but especially that God hath received a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand unkindnesses from him for every one that he hath received from others; and that its not equal to expect, that God should pass by his, when he will not pass by theirs. He dreads the doom of that's servant, who when his Lord had forgiven him <hi>ten thousand talents,</hi> would not forgive his fellow servant <hi>a hundred pence;</hi> he was delivered to the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, till he should pay all that was due, that for ever. <hi>So shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not every one his Brother their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasses, Matth.</hi> 18.23. <hi>to</hi> 35. A good man would not lose <hi>Heaven,</hi> to keep such a <hi>Hell</hi> in his Spirit as pride and wrath would enkindle there, to be but the pledge of a <hi>worse</hi> at his death. He would by no means be without the <hi>badge</hi> and <hi>cognizance</hi> of Christs Disciples, whereby he would have them known,<note place="margin">1 John 13.35.</note>
                     <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>charity,</hi> which he tryes by that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180407:37"/> touch-stone in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. to 8. He looks to the good thoughts, good will, good words, and good deeds of charity too. He confines it not to the bodies of others, but hath a kindness also for their souls, and he <hi>sends</hi> his <hi>bounty a begging</hi> to them on the behalf of their welfare; while his <hi>alms</hi> come to request their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of that service, which his best advice is ready to render to their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal interest.</p>
                  <p>He is very careful to perform the duties, the several relations he stands in oblige him to, as having great reason to suspect, that he is void of goodness, if he be not good in them. Seeing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties make up a very great part of Religion; and that he, who allows himself in the breach of <hi>any one command, is guilty of all,</hi> though he should observe the rest, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. Because he keeps none out of a right obedience to God, as enjoyning them, for if he did so, he would keep that which he breaks (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enjoyned) as well as the rest. He would not neglect what God hath made his duty to others, because they fail in theirs to him. If you <hi>love them who love you; or do good to them who do good to you,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180407:38"/> what thank have you? for sinners also do even the same;</hi> Luke 6.32, 33. But <hi>Saints</hi> must do more, <hi>Love and do good to those who hate and despightfully use them,</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:180407:42"/> and supplication for all Saints.</hi> The pious man thinks it not fit for him and his, to defer begging their daily bread (that is, a supply of all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral wants of the day) till the day be spent and past; or to ask their heavenly Fathers blessing, only when they go to bed, and not when they rise. He accounts prayer as requisite a <hi>Preface</hi> as a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> to the <hi>acts</hi> of the day. Since there is as much need of preservation from danger in the day as in the night, and more from sin, and of direction in their course, and of a blessing upon family-affairs and interests, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected where it is not begged, Prov. 3.33. <hi>The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked, but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</hi> Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the families that call not on thy name.</hi> If he be worse than an <hi>Infidel,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides not for the <hi>bodies</hi> of those in his family, sure he is not so good as a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> who takes no care of their <hi>souls,</hi> who neglects daily family-prayer, or does it but by halves. Such as serve God but once a day, shew a great insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of their dependance on him, both for what they have and need, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180407:42"/> but little love to him or their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that they owe their Religion more to Custome than Conscience. But he who acts from conscience, follows the example of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10.2.</note> who was <hi>a devout man, and feared</hi> (that is, worshipped) <hi>the Lord with all his house, and prayed to God alway,</hi> that's at least, twice a day. He looks also upon reading the Word as a requisite compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of prayer, to instruct all in the house in their duties, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. &amp; 17.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. which he whets upon them, and is careful to inform them well in the principles of Religion, that they may neither run into Error nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness. The abounding of both which, as also of ignorance, yea, even in those who are soberer, and of unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by Sermons and good Books, through an inability to understand the terms and phrases relating to the grounds of Religion (as what faith, justification, sanctification, redemption, adoption, the Offices of Christ, his Intercession, the Covenant of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are) which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurr in them; The abounding of all these, is to be charged upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Families neglecting to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180407:43"/> those well who are under their charge, which will dreadfully aggravate their accounts at the Great Day, when they shall have the miscarriages of so many set on their score. Religion was first born and bred up in families for a long time in the beginning of the world; and it must still be maintained there, or it cannot subsist; Because fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are the elements of which all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties (and both Church and State) are composed. Therefore it's Satans great design to stifle it there, but the good man will not suffer it where he hath any thing to do. To which end he is also careful that neither he nor his commit that <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of alienating the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> from those holy employments to which it hath been impropriated. He thinks it very unreasonable to steal any part of it, for the world, lusts, sports, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When Divine bounty hath been so much more liberal to his temporal occasions than to his own service, as to allow him six dayes for one: and the rather since that <hi>one</hi> is designed for his <hi>souls</hi> good, as the <hi>other</hi> for his <hi>bodies.</hi> Therefore those that do not rightly employ it, shew they neither care for God nor their souls,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180407:43"/> and that they love their sloth, gain, or game better than either. Nor doth the gracious man only serve God by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes rest, but by his six dayes labour too. He strives both to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit, serving the Lord, and not sloathful in business. He is every day careful that the <hi>world</hi> may not <hi>rob</hi> him of his <hi>God,</hi> nor the <hi>Devil</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> nor <hi>seducers</hi> of his <hi>faith,</hi> nor his <hi>enemies</hi> of his <hi>love,</hi> nor his <hi>friends</hi> of his <hi>time.</hi> He is willing to lay it out for them, but not to lose it among them. He accounts company no excuse from redeeming time, and that all society should be improved to some good purpose. Therefore where he is engaged, he endeavours the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course may be so managed, as to serve the designs of piety, or some useful knowledge, or some way or other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to his own or others good; and not to be <hi>a wind</hi> that <hi>blows no body any profit,</hi> much less a <hi>hurtful</hi> one, like that of many which serves only to <hi>blow out</hi> mens <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>blow</hi> up their <hi>lusts,</hi> or <hi>blow dust</hi> into their <hi>eyes,</hi> or a <hi>frost</hi> into their <hi>hearts</hi> (to <hi>cool</hi> good affections, and take away the very <hi>breath</hi> of spiritual <hi>life</hi>) or to <hi>blast</hi> others repute, or <hi>toss</hi> their failings
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180407:44"/> to and fro, or to lend <hi>wings</hi> to time to fly away the more easily. How little discourse is to be found ordinarily amongst men, of which this is not the best that can be said, that it is useless. The holy man useth the <hi>holy, reverend, dreadful and glorious name</hi> of God with all seriousness and reverence, much unlike those who do not only not sanctifie, but abuse it, by an ordinary prostituting of it, only to fill up the vacuities of their common discourse; often, with as little sense and pertinency as reverence, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larding an <hi>O Lord, O God, O Jesu;</hi> who besides that they violate the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, by using Gods name so vainly, and so put themselves into the number of those whom God will not hold guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; (who shall be liable to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they be not to mans) they commit no small absurdity in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their mouths at that rate, as if they thought those little things that excite their admiration should raise the like in God. And can he repute it any other than a high affront, to be so often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on by them, when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say to him? How would a King or Noble Personage resent it, if so
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180407:44"/> served by those that are about him? What is this, but for men to tell those they converse with, that though they pray <hi>Gods name may be hallowed,</hi> yet they do not intend it shall be done by them?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The gracious, man is a <hi>Paradox, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; derision</hi> to the men of his generation. They neither understand nor affect him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He is not understood by them,</hi> he is a Riddle to them. For in him is to be found (when in his best temper) the friendly greet of a heavenly raisedness of mind, and a humble condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the happy match of poverty and bravery of Spirit; the fast embraces of wisdom and simplicity; the lovely white and red of innocency and injured pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the sweet accord of sorrow and joy, the several affections <hi>tuning</hi> their <hi>discords</hi> into a delightful <hi>harmony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He <hi>lives upon trust,</hi> and the more he goes on trust, the better his <hi>credit</hi> is. He <hi>seeks himself</hi> most when he <hi>denyes</hi> himself; He is sure to <hi>have his will</hi> by <hi>praying</hi> heartily that he may <hi>not have it,</hi> that not <hi>his</hi> will, but <hi>Gods</hi> may be done. Those temporal things he usually holds the fastest, which he is ready to let go: The <hi>looser</hi> he sits to them, the <hi>faster</hi> they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:180407:45"/> cleave to him. He is most advanced by abasement; and the lowlier he is, the higher and nearer Heaven. If he have store of temporal advantages and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: No man enjoyes them so much, for he enjoyes them both in this world, and in that to come. In this world, by a higher content and delight, because he more rellishes the love and goodness of God in them, and is more sensible of his own unworthiness, which makes the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies appear greater to him. And in the other world he shall receive upon <hi>Gods Bill of Exchange,</hi> his promises, whatever he <hi>paid</hi> out here to <hi>charity and piety.</hi> If he have <hi>not riches,</hi> he is <hi>richer</hi> in his <hi>poverty,</hi> than others in their <hi>wealth.</hi> His <hi>hopes</hi> are <hi>more worth</hi> than all the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <hi>possessions.</hi> He enjoyes <hi>more</hi> in an <hi>earnest,</hi> than they in their <hi>whole bargains.</hi> The very <hi>evils</hi> that befall him are <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blessings</hi> than all their <hi>goods.</hi> When he is stript of all that men can take from him, he hath still a treasure left within, and another above. He who hath godliness with contentment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he <hi>wants,</hi> he hath <hi>enough;</hi> and when he hath <hi>least,</hi> he usually hath <hi>most;</hi> most of that which is most worth the having,

When he seems to have <hi>nothing,</hi> yet he hath <hi>all;</hi> he hath Christ in whom <hi>all fulness dwells,</hi> and who is <hi>all in all,</hi> and he is such an <hi>heir</hi> as the world cannot shew another so great, heir to an eternal Kingdom and Crown of Glory. If he suffer upon a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous account, God often lets in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivings and refreshments, as make his very <hi>sorrows to smile,</hi> and <hi>tribulation</hi> it self to be <hi>joyful.</hi> However he ballances his pressures with such supports as secure him from such despondencies, as make the hearts of many sink in the height of their mirth. His <hi>calamities</hi> are <hi>more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> than luxurious persons <hi>jollities;</hi> and his <hi>disgrace</hi> for Christ and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness sake, <hi>more glorious</hi> than all their <hi>honour, Matth.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>

Ignorant,<note place="margin">Prov. 29.27.</note> loose and sensual persons like him not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his faith and manners differ from theirs. For his <hi>manners</hi> are framed by the <hi>Rule</hi> of Gods Word, and theirs by the <hi>unruliness</hi> of their own lusts. His <hi>faith</hi> is built upon what <hi>God saith,</hi>

Theirs is indeed a <hi>faith of Miracles,</hi> which can easily <hi>remove</hi> the most <hi>mountainous difficulties</hi> out of the way to Heaven, yea, and <hi>remove Heaven</hi> it self, and set it at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>broad way.</hi> It can reconcile God and sin, and make a match between the most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wickedness and everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. It can cut off the <hi>entail</hi> of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> of the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and make it pass from them to the children of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Its a faith that can make evil good, and good evil; give credit to things most incredible, yea, impossible, as that God who is <hi>Truth</hi> it self will <hi>not be true</hi> to his own threatnings. That though themselves be never so bad, yet their condition is good, and let them displease God never so much, yet he is well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.<note place="margin">Prov. 15.8, 9.</note> That they are in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, though he hath declared their way to be an abomination to him. That though they rant, and swell, and swear, and whore; yea, though they fight
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:180407:46"/> against God and goodness in the forlorn hope of the Prince of Darkness while they live, yet that Divine embraces, and the rewards and joyes of the other world await them.</p>
                  <p>The Gracious person meets with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reproaches from worldly men, but those reproaches are commonly so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to light on his excellencies, and so <hi>dash out</hi> their own <hi>brains.</hi> For such men are <hi>adversaries to him, because he follows the thing that good is, Psalm</hi> 38.20. And his departing from evil makes him a <hi>prey, Isa.</hi> 59.14. Yea, so equal a share have malice and folly in their reproaches cast on him, that they are the greatest reproaches to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are witnesses of their own falshood, whilest the only reason they have for them is the greatest reason against them. For they account him a <hi>fool,</hi> because he is <hi>truly wise:</hi> almost <hi>out of his wits,</hi> because with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> he is <hi>come to himself:</hi> a <hi>hypocrite,</hi> because he is <hi>sincere:</hi> low-spirited, because he is heavenly-minded; <hi>obstinate</hi> because <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to God: the <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>off-scouring</hi> of all things, because he is so much for <hi>purity</hi> and against defilement; most blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180407:47"/> because most unblamable; to offend, when he will not offend; and to do ill, because he doth well. We find in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4. those who <hi>walk in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousness, lusts, excess of Wine, revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, &amp;c.</hi> wondering, or <hi>thinking it strange that he runs not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of him,</hi> but <hi>they shall give an account to the judge of quick and dead for it.</hi> And well they may expect to do so: For what can be more wonderful than their wonder? What more prodigiously strange than to think strangely of him (as they in effect do) that he had not rather be like the Devil than God? For unholiness is the Devils image, as holiness is Gods.

How little wit do those, who would go for <hi>great wits,</hi> shew in accounting him <hi>dull,</hi> because he will not be prophane, not make jests of seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, nor delight in scorning?

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180407:49"/> him, because he is <hi>better than the mighty,</hi> in being slow to anger, and is able to <hi>do more than he who takes a City, by ruling his own Spirit,</hi> Prov. 16.32. And can bear an injury, which their impotency cannot.</p>
                  <p>How wisely do many censure him for <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>ill-bred,</hi> because he hath not the <hi>civility</hi> to <hi>sin</hi> for <hi>company?</hi> not that piece <hi>of manners</hi> to <hi>go out of the way</hi> of God and his duty, to <hi>wait</hi> upon others in their <hi>extravagancies?</hi> Cannot admire Vanity, nor applaud vice, but reproves instead of flattering those who harbour it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wants the <hi>gracefulness</hi> of a <hi>careless deportment,</hi> and a <hi>forehead</hi> that can <hi>refuse to be ashamed,</hi> a confidence unmoved at the greatest presence, though Divine, and able to sin without blushing?

                  <p>The <hi>Voluptuous</hi> (as unreasonably still) think him a man of no <hi>gust,</hi> abandoned to stupidity, and void of the sentiments
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:180407:49"/> due to his nature, because those <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> which are of so high a <hi>price,</hi> that not only an earthly, but an heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, must go to the purchase of them, are of no <hi>rellish</hi> with him: Because he will not give up the solace of a good conscience, the comforts of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and the offers of eternal joyes, a prey to a few moments enjoyment of sensual delights, or those polluted and criminal pleasures, which pay for their short welcome in the uneasie stings of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reflections, and the sad presages of future vengeance: Because he will not make a <hi>present</hi> of his honour; chastity, strength and wealth to any <hi>vile affection,</hi> or for those <hi>enjoyments,</hi> which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to <hi>mourn at the last, and say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, Prov.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. Because he cannot find more pleasure in conversing with his <hi>Hawks</hi> and <hi>Doggs,</hi> than with <hi>God:</hi> Because he is not so <hi>jolly</hi> as to go to Hell in a <hi>frolick;</hi> or will not spend his <hi>soul</hi> upon his <hi>body</hi> while he lives, and leave both to the <hi>worms</hi> when he dyes; his body to those in the <hi>grave,</hi> and his soul to that in <hi>Hell</hi> (bred of his indulged corruption) which never dyes.

Because he is not willing to <hi>be robbed of himself,</hi> and be at the <hi>charge</hi> to have it done? Cannot think a cup too much worth paying his reason for, or forfeiting the fullest draughts of those pleasures at Gods right hand for ever? Cannot drink his own <hi>confusion</hi> to others <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>pledge men</hi> so long, as till he be obliged to <hi>pledge God</hi> too in a <hi>Cup of the Wine of his wrath?</hi> Cannot be induced to imitate many others, in drinking God out of his mind, understanding out of his head, feeling out of his heart, busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness out of his hand, health out of his body, money out of his purse, his family out of doors, himself into misery, and Gods judgements into the place where he lives? Because he will not merit that <hi>wo,</hi> in Isa. 5.22. <hi>Wo to them who are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to drink Wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink. Able sinners!</hi> whose <hi>glory</hi> it is, that they offend not out of

Strange! that any men should account it worthy their ambition to merit Gods wo! That they should so far neglect the dignity of their nature, designed to an imitation of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of Beings, as to labour to render themselves the veriest <hi>Bruites</hi> that ever were without the priviledge of a <hi>trough,</hi> and esteem it a mighty attainment to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble</hi> a <hi>spunge,</hi> or be eminent in that <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> wherein a <hi>hogshead</hi> excells them. Nor are such excused, in that their large draughts are not more than their brains, since they are more than tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will bear, than nature can need (as rather oppressing than relieving it) and so than can consist with a due care of preserving both body and soul in good plight, and than piety will allow, which requires an eating and <hi>drinking to Gods glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Whereto this practice is not a little prejudicial, as disposing to many evils, passion, fury, strife, lust, levity, corrupt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neglect of duties both Religious and Civil, and great waste of time and of Gods good Creatures, and often a make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

It being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by some a valorous part, to drink others under the Table, in which while they triumph and sport themselves, they rejoyce to see God dishonoured, his creatures abused, his Image defaced in others, their bodies wronged, and their souls much more. And shall this be counted <hi>manly?</hi> What is more the Devils part, than to draw men to sin at as high a rate as may be, and urge them to their own ruine? Such as make others drunk, may read their particular <hi>wo</hi> in <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.15, 16. The <hi>principles</hi> of such intemperate persons may well <hi>stretch</hi> to any thing, being so throughly <hi>soaked,</hi> and their <hi>conscience</hi> be <hi>silent</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when it hath been often duck't for a <hi>scold:</hi> and if they reproach the holy man, it were for him too much to value their judgements to regard it. But the most general charge and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation cast upon him, is that he is too precise and <hi>strict,</hi> and <hi>makes more ado than needs</hi> in Religion. Of the Authors of which I shall demand thus, Doth he more than God requires both of him and you in these and the like commands?

                  <p>If you be young, by no means listen to those who would perswade you to put off your amendment to a further time, and bespeak you after this rate; <hi>Piety is too grave for you; much seriousness will spoil your wit. Take no spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, but when you are sick: purge not your self while you are young. Let not any heat of zeal wither the flower of youth: bury not your beauty in the wrinkles of godly sorrow. Indulge your spirits in the spring of your dayes, and let the world reap the fruits of your ripest age; your dotage will serve that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly thing, Religion.

Work not while it is day, but when the night comes. Mind matters of less moment while you can do any thing, and your main interest, when you are fit for nothing. Defer your repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance till hereafter, though you know not but you may dye to night. Put it off to a sick-bed, though you cannot tell but suddain death may prevent your lying at all: Or if not so, yet your sickness may take away your senses: or if you enjoy these, yet your hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to the very last, may still make you delay your repentance: Or if you have any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, your pain may exceedingly unfit you for it: Or if you do any thing that way, the sincerity of your repentance will be very suspitious, not only as wanting the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a reformed life to evidence it, when death follows soon after, but also as most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at such a time to spring only from the fear of Hell, and so to be such as will do you no good. Run as long and as far as you can out of the way to life, even till you be out of breath, and then return. First let your time be spent and then improve it. Think not of amending
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180407:55"/> your life till it be done. Increase your debts to purpose, and be sure you have a good long score, and then pay. Provoke God as much as you are able, and then appease him. Let ill habits take the deepest root, and then they will be most conveniently pluckt up. Give your hearts as many mortal wounds as you can, and then think of a cure. Never have to do with the Physitian till your disease have brought you to the gates of death. Be</hi> Solomons <hi>Fool the greatest part of your life, its enough to be wise when you are old. Do not serve God till your lust turn you off, as too impotent for them. Let them have your strength, your weakness may suffice him. Offer up the best of your dayes, your floridest blood and briskest spirits to the Destroyer; and reserve your duller phlegm, the</hi> Caput mortuum <hi>of your old age, the very setlings of the last running of your time for your Saviour. Be sure you treasure up as much wrath as you can here, and then doubt not but you shall live well hereafter. Be but a faithful servant to the Flesh and the Devil while you live, and then confidently expect Heaven for your reward when you dye.</hi>

                     <hi>Branch</hi> II. Gods plants must abound in fruit: They must not only bring forth such fruits for kind, as are before set down, but much of them for quantity. The Trees of Righteousness must bear abundantly, he loadned with fruits of piety, charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence the Apostle prayes for the <hi>Philippians, Chap.</hi> 1.11. that they <hi>might be filled with the fruits of righteousness.</hi> And for the <hi>Colossians,</hi> Chap. 1.10. That they <hi>might walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every good work.</hi> And he exhorts the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to be <hi>alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons why the Righteous must and shall be fruitful, are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> I. Because this is the End of all Gods pains, cost and patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to make them bring forth both good fruit, and good store of it. For therefore are these <hi>Trees of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Well planted,</hi> both in an excellent stock, and in a very fertile soil.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In an excellent stock,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 15.5▪</note> even <hi>Christ the true Vine; the Tree of Life,</hi> from whom all our fruit is found, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.8. We are told in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. that we Gentiles

They are <hi>well-watered</hi> with the dew of Heaven, with showers of blessing, with <hi>Sions</hi> streams, which make glad the City of God, and make fruitful the Trees of the Lord, with those waters of the Sanctuary, the Ordinances of God, which, if faithfully dispenced, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improved, are great means of fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying. In this respect the godly man is like to a Tree planted by the Rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season.

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>well look't to</hi> night and day, with a watchful eye of Providence, even of the <hi>Keeper of Israel,</hi> who neither slumbers nor sleeps. His eyes are upon them from one end of the year to the other for good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>well waited on.</hi> So doth God long after his childrens ripe fruits, that he is still sending his servants, or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180407:62"/> rather coming himself time after time, to see what fruits grow on their boughs, and to receive or gather them. This is intimated in the Parable of the Fig-tree, Luke 13.7. <hi>Behold these three years I come seeking fruit, &amp;c.</hi> God seeks fruit on his Trees, and he comes often and long for it, year after year. He hath great patience to stay for it, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues he hath a great desire to receive it. Christ is often <hi>coming down into the Garden of Nuts,</hi> that is, the Church, to see how his plants take and bear, <hi>to see the fruits of the Valley,</hi> whether the <hi>Vine flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and the Pomegranates bud, Cant.</hi> 6.11. to gather his Myrrh and his Spice, and to feed there, on his pleasant fruits, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p>All these six things considered, God may make his people Judges in the case, What could have been done more for them that he hath not done? as we find him doing in <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.3, 4. Well-planting, well-watering, well-fencing, &amp;c. all these <hi>Wells</hi> on Gods part, ingage us to bear fruit <hi>well:</hi> Which therefore God may justly expect to receive from us.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.34</note> For <hi>who plants a Vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. and that in some
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180407:62"/> measure proportionable to his great cost and pains. And God is wont by these means to produce fruitfulness in his people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> II. Because its an honour to God, and a very acceptable sight to see his Trees bear well. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit,</hi> John 15.8. <hi>Being filled with the fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God,</hi> Phil. 1.11. And fruitfulness in every good work is the way to walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> III. Because it is the greatest praise and commendation of the godly, to be full of goodness and good works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. As it is of Fields to be full of Grass and Corn, of Trees to be full of fruits. Yea, it is a credit to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, an ornament and honour to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For the goodness and plenty of the fruits or performances of Professors, proves to the world, the truth, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, power and efficacy of the Religion they profess. For this is the Rule to try Religions by: <hi>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 7.16, 17, 18.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:180407:63"/> That Religion in reason must needs be best, the professors whereof bring forth best fruits, even of holiness and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and those in abundance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> IV. Because this is the way for Christians to be exemplary, to shine as lights before men, and to provoke others to imitation. For a fruitful life is an amiable and beautiful object, and so may well be taking with such as stand and look upon it.</p>
                  <p>For these Reasons, as God may well command his peoples fruitfulness, so he will be ready to promote it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> I. Here then is matter of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Gods people for their,

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Degenerateness,</hi> in bringing forth evil fruits; as neglect of Ordinances and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both in esteem, attendance on, and profiting by them, instead of fruits of piety. Uncharitableness, hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, passion, oppression, revenge, instead of fruits of charity and righteousness. Self-seeking, and minding only our own things, instead of self-denyal and publick-spiritedness.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:180407:63"/> Pride, vanity, excess in the use of Creatures, impatience in the change of our condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> instead of humility, sobriety, patience. The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of many corruptions in the room of Graces. Let those that be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gods house, examine their hearts and lives well, and they shall find good store of such Wormwood and Hemlock, such bitter fruits there; which they have cause to be deeply sensible of, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for. Trees of nature (that are senseless and reasonless) may shame and condemn Trees of Grace, (that have sense, reason and Religion in them) in that those bring forth fruit according to their kind, (whereupon Christ grounds his speech that <hi>a Tree is known by his Fruit,</hi> Matth. 12.33.) but these many times bring forth fruit contrary to their kind; the Trees of Righteousness, fruits of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; which very ill become them, and are as unseemly as for a Vine to bring forth Thorns, or a Fig-tree, Thistles. Its as ill a sight as may be to see a Child of light do any works of darkness: to see a circumspect walker wander out of the way, or a professor of Religion conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him or her self to the world. This
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:180407:64"/> overturns the course both of nature and grace, when <hi>good Trees</hi> bring forth <hi>evil fruits.</hi> Hereby we both bear false witness against our selves, giving others reason to account our Trees naught, because the fruits are bad that grow from them. And we give great offence to God our planter, who is much displeased to see such as he hath planted <hi>a noble Vine,</hi> thus to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the degenerate plant of a strange Vine</hi> unto him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. When Gods people whose name he had called <hi>a green Olive-tree, fair and of goodly fruit,</hi> brought forth evil fruits of leudness and Idolatry, he was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed that he kindled a fire thereon, and would not allow their <hi>branches</hi> any longer to <hi>spread</hi> themselves in his <hi>Courts, Jer.</hi> 11.15, 16, 17. So when oppression grew o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>his pleasant plant</hi> (the men of <hi>Judah</hi>) and <hi>his Vineyard</hi> (the house of <hi>Israel</hi>) brought forth <hi>wild grapes,</hi> he resolves to lay it wast, and to command the clouds not to rain upon it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Barrenness of good fruits is to be bewailed. Being seldome in holy duties and not very serious and fervent in them Bringing forth fruits not to God, but to our selves. Not pittying, succouring, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others what we can. Being poor i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:180407:64"/> prayers and indeavours for advancing <hi>Sions</hi> welfare, and diverting of common calamities. Putting forth few acts of Grace, and driving but a small trade of Christianity. So that we may take up the Prophets complaint concerning our selves, which he uttered in another sense, Mich. 7.1. <hi>Woe is me, for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage,</hi> when a man seeks for a <hi>cluster</hi> of grapes, but can find <hi>none to eat;</hi> or if any, but thin strewed, here one and there one. Let us consider how we by our barrenness frustrate Christs appointment and ordination of us to fruitfulness. For thus speaks he as a Vine to his branches in John 15.16. <hi>I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should bring forth fruit,</hi> &amp;c. And how ill do we requite the Lord for his great cost and pains with us? How little hath God of honour, the Gospel of credit, our selves of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and others of benefit by our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And how much reason do we give God either to remove the means of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, or to deprive us of our standing under them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> II. Let us then be exhorted to bring forth fruits, even such as be come the <hi>stock</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:180407:65"/> we are grafted in, Christ; the <hi>Soil</hi> we are planted in, Gods house; the showers of blessings we are watered with, Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; the planter whose Trees we are, God himself; and the kind, what Trees we are, Trees of Righteousness. And let us bear fruits in abundance, and that according to the means afforded us whereby, and the time wherein to be fruitfull. And the more to quicken us hereto, let us consider that if we be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in good works,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Motives.</note>1. Then God will bless all our other fruits, of body, ground, cattel, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then we shall be full of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, because we shall eat the fruit of our doings, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.10. which were they not good would be bitterness to us in the latter end. Yea then however things go, <hi>though our Trees should not blossome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Habak. 3.17.</note>
                     <hi>and our fields yield no meat: though the flock should be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the stalls, yet</hi> (with Habakkuk) <hi>we might rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of our salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This may be a means to escape tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral stroaks. For as God commanded that fruit-bearing trees should not be cut
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:180407:65"/> down, no not in War, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.19, 20. so when he sent to hew down those degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate plants the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (where <hi>pride had budded and violence was risen up into a rod of wickedness;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 7.10, 11.</note>) he mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out such as had the fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hanging on them, and gave the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers charge not to stir or come near them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 6. And seeing <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> one of the seven Churches planted in <hi>Asia,</hi> was so well root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to continue firm and immoveable, and bore so well, as that Christ found no fault with her, he promised to secure her from that general storm, which was coming upon the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8, 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This will greatly further our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and increase our reward against the day of reckoning. For as we abound in good fruits, so fruits abound to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.17. God will give every one according to the fruit of his doings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.19. He will reward us according to our works: then the more work for God, the more reward from him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> perswades the Corinthians all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to abound in the work of the Lord, because they knew their labour was not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:180407:66"/> in vain in the Lord. If we have our fruit unto holiness, we shall have the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. And that may be sufficient to incourage and ingage us to the greatest fruitfulness, since it will so abundantly recompence it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How fruitful are the wicked in the wayes of fin and iniquity, and shall not the righteous be so in the wayes of God and the exercises of Godliness? What incouragements have the wicked to their fruitfulness, comparable to those which the righteous have to theirs? How vile is the fruit of the one, and how bitter will it prove in the end; How pretious is that of the other, and how sweet in the issue?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Barrenness in such Trees as are planted in Gods house, in those that live under Gods Ordinances, shall be punished with everlasting destruction. When <hi>John Baptist</hi> Preached repentance in the Wilderness of <hi>Judea,</hi> he tells his hearers, that <hi>Now the axe is laid to the root of the Trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire,</hi> Matth. 3.10. and 7.19. When God plants Men and Women in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, placeth them where the Gospel is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:180407:66"/> Preached, he layes an axe to the root of their Tree,<note place="margin">Luke 13.6, 7.</note> setting them a time (as he did the Fig-tree three years) for bearing fruit, and if they bear not fruit within that time, he will cut them down, because they cumber the ground, and cast them into fire unquenchable. Think thus; If I be barren in Gods house, I am a burden to the place where I live, and take up that room which a fruitful plant might stand in. Woe is me, I may fear cutting down, and casting out of this house, this garden of God every day. Better be barren in any part of the world than here. Better never have been a plant, (a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a visible Church) yea never born, than live barren. If I had any fastening to Christ, my barrenness cuts me quite off as a dead branch. For Christ saith, Joh. 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he (i. e.</hi> my Father) <hi>taketh away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if these considerations or motives excite any sincere desires of fruitfulness,<note place="margin">Means.</note> the <hi>Means</hi> to attain it may be these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Get to be cut out of the Crab-stock of nature, the Wild-olive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. in which while you remain (whilest in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180407:67"/> an unregenerate condition) you can bring forth only sowre, wild and bitter fruits, <hi>grapes of gall and bitter clusters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Get to be grafted into Christ the <hi>good Olive,</hi> to partake of his root and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is the chief cause of all fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>As the branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without me</hi> (or severed from me) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> We should get our natures moulded anew in Christ. Here the stock must change the graft into its own nature. Till then we cannot bring forth fruits to God. <hi>Make the Tree good, then the fruit will be good,</hi> Mat. 12.33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suck and draw daily much spiritual juice and sap by faith, and inlarged desires from Christ in and by the Ordinances. From him <hi>all the body</hi> (and so all his branches) <hi>having nourishment ministred, increaseth with the increase of God,</hi> Col. 2.19. Joh. 1.16. By this means belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers abide in Christ, cleaving fast to him by faith, and he abides in them, by the influence of his spirit and grace, and so they are enabled to bring forth much fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. which place carryes the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180407:67"/> force of a promise, that such as adhere to Christ shall be fruitfull; he will make them so: for he there takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the title and relation of the true Vine, and therefore will not fail to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the part of the generous Vine to his firm branches, in imparting sap and vigour to them to make them fructifie.</p>
                  <p>This brings me to the fourth Means.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lay hold on promises of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and particularly on the Text. For as its Gods pleasure that his people being planted in his house, should be fruitfull, fat and flourishing, so its his promise that they shall be so. He may let the wicked spring, and spread, and flourish as to their temporal condition; <hi>v.</hi> 9. of this 92. <hi>Psalm.</hi> but he will cause the righteous to grow and prosper, to be full of fruits, sap and verdure as to their spiritual. And that to shew that the Lord is upright, that there is no unrighteousness in him, no inequality in his dispensations: but that it still goes well with the Righteous, and God tenders their prosperity, in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, and that they have a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter share of his favour and bounty, and are in a much better condition than the wicked (how flourishing soever) if we
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180407:68"/> consider their better part. God doth much more for their inward man than for the others outward: and he will do so for the vindication of his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. In <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.5, 6, 7. God promiseth to <hi>be as the</hi> (fructifying) <hi>dew</hi> to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>who should blossome as the Lilly, cast forth their roots as</hi> the goodly trees of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> have the beauty of holiness and stability in the faith. <hi>Their branches should spread,</hi> their knowledge and grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; their activity for God and their own souls, and their charity to men be more extended and reach further. <hi>Their beauty should be as the Olive,</hi> composed of a constant freshness of profession and of fruitfulness in conversation, answerable to the ornaments of that Tree, whose greenness is perpetual and fruit very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. <hi>Their smell</hi> should be <hi>as Lebanon,</hi> as that of the odoriferous Trees and Herbs which grew there, or <hi>their scent should be as the Wine of Lebanon,</hi> which was of the best sort,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.41. Act. 10.4. Heb. 13.15, 16. Phil. 4 18.</note>
                     <hi>vers.</hi> 7. Their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sacrifices, their prayers, praises, almes, and good works should be an <hi>odour of a sweet smell</hi> in the nostrills of God; and they themselves perfume the places where they live with their gracious
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:180407:68"/> communication and example, and leave their name well-scented when they dye. <hi>They should revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine;</hi> that is, as some well observe, that as the Corn suffering much from Frost, Hail, Snow, Tempest, lieth for dead as it were in Winter, but at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Sun in the Spring reviveth and yieldeth a great increase: And as the Vine being pruned and lopped, not only spreads again, but hereby becomes more fruitful: so God promiseth that his people though enduring sharp and sore afflictions, yet should have a reviving out of them, and also a thriving by them, their fruits should be more and better. In the last place, he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. That <hi>He</hi> himself <hi>is like a green Fir-tree,</hi> for sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness: he is their shade on their right hand, their covert and defence from evils: and not only so, but he is also the root and spring of all their good, even of that they do, as well as of that they have, <hi>From him is their fruit found.</hi> It is by his communication of spiritual strength and vigour, by the supply of his Grace, that their fruits are brought forth▪ which therefore they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him, and may confidently, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180407:69"/> he hath made so free Offers and Promises thereof. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.31.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Improve Sabbaths, those dayes of the Sun of righteousness, those lightsome and growth some times, those solemn opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of receiving Divine influences. Make much of them, and take heed of losing any part of them. This 92. <hi>Psalm</hi> is intituled a Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day, and it seems to set forth the end of Gods Institution and our observation of it, both in respect of God, to praise him for his mercies, and meditate on his works, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in respect of our selves, that we may grow in grace, and be fruitful in obedience, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance whereof, is the end of all the duties and exercises of the day, and of our converse with God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereon, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Depend upon God for his blessing on all the means of fruitfulness, to make them effectual to us for that purpose. Frequent Ordinances, and perform duties diligently, but rest not in your so doing, without relying on Gods blessing for the efficacy of them, as reckoning that this only can make you fruitful under them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180407:69"/> in your souls, as it makes all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fruitful after their kind, and so men in their bodies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.22, 28. <hi>God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve, <hi>and said to them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the Earth.</hi> And the same words he used to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.1. And <hi>God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, &amp;c.</hi> saith <hi>Isaac</hi> to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.3. The blessing of God makes rich in good works, as well as in Silver and Gold.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Psal 5.12. &amp; 24.4, 5.</note> And its made over to the righteous by Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9, 16. and they are called to <hi>inherit a blessing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.9.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Make conscience of all your thoughts, words, deeds, and of all the motions and demeanors of soul and body, to regulate them all by the word of God, that every twig of you may bring him some fruit. For every of these bring forth <hi>fruit,</hi> either <hi>to life or death,</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell. Therefore we read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>of the fruit of the thoughts,</hi> Jer. 6.19. for which, if they be not good, God will bring evil upon the thinkers. And of the <hi>fruit of the heart,</hi> Isa. 10.12. <hi>I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the King of</hi> Assyria, <hi>and the glory of his high looks.</hi> And of <hi>the fruit of the mouth,</hi> Prov. 12.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:180407:70"/> 13, 14. And of <hi>the hands,</hi> Prov. 31.31. And <hi>of the doings,</hi> Jer. 17.10. &amp; 21.14. Mic. 7.13. Seeing then fruits grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your minds, hearts, lips, hands, yea, on your eys, ears, feet, on all the faculties of soul, and members of body, have a care to order them well, that those fruits may be good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19, 22.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Take all opportunities of doing God service, and others good, and of furthering your own salvation. And beg of God Heavenly Wisdom to take and improve all occasions for well-doing, for that is <hi>full of good fruits, Jam.</hi> 3.17. Beg a Spirit of communion and largness of heart, to be forward and ready to every good work, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the gales of the Spirit of God, which (like the wind) blowing upon the garden of our souls, will make the spices thereof flow out, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. Not only spiritual Graces, but the exercise of them, and the performance of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duties, are the fruits of the Spirit in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.9.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Take heed of what may hinder fruitfulness; as will any sin allowed, and particularly Hypocrisie, which is want of depth of earth, and immoderate cares of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180407:70"/> the world, which like Thorns choak the Seed of the Word, and keep the fruits of the Spirit from thriving: and hardness of heart, which is dryness of root, and so makes the branches barren. The heart is the root of a man, and this <hi>root of the righteous</hi> being moistned with godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>yieldeth fruit, Prov.</hi> 12.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> II. God will have his people <hi>still</hi> fruitful, yea, <hi>even in old age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Still,</hi> from the time of their being planted in Gods House, on, daily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to the time of their dissolution, or removal to the Heavenly Paradise; even,
<list>
                        <item>1. Through all the <hi>parts</hi> of life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> writes his first Epistle to Christians of all ages, little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, young men, Fathers, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13.</item>
                        <item>2. Through all the conditions of life, and the several alterations of them, which have their proper fruits belonging to them: As Fruits of patience, humbleness, self-denyal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to afflictions. Fruits of thankfulness, obedience, watchfulness, to prosperity. Gods
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180407:71"/> Trees bring forth fruit as well in the Winter of Adversity, as in the Summer of Prosperity. There is not one day in a year, nor scarce an hour in a day, but God ordains and calls us to bear some fruit, in one kind or other. Its record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> that the word brought forth fruit in them, since the day they heard it, and knew the Grace of God in truth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Even in old age,</hi> and that both in respect of Nature and Grace, will God have his people fruitful; as was <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. In old age he was in bonds for Christ and begat <hi>Onesimus</hi> to God, <hi>Philem.</hi> 9, 10. and <hi>David</hi> who in his own Generation served the will of God till he fell on sleep,<note n="*" place="margin">See the Margin.</note>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36.</p>
                  <p>Now God may well require his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be fruitful continually, and even when old;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is <hi>spring-time</hi> with the righteous all their life long. For as the end of the world is the general harvest, so is the end of a Christian, his death, his particular one. He and all his fruits are not ripe till then, and therefore not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:180407:71"/> cut down with the sickle of death, or reaped till then; but must grow in the mean while, and be still bearing fruit. For the fruits of the righteous are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in season. Whence the commands of praying continually, of preaching, and consequently of hearing in season and out of season, of reading in Gods Book all our dayes, of meditating on his Law night and day, of rejoycing ever more, of offering the Sacrifice of praise to God continually, of not forgetting to do good and to communicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because God is still doing us good, and unwearied therein, his mercies are new on us every morning, and he daily lades us with benefits, it becomes us to be continually laden with fruits: and that especially seeing God is ever affording means of fruitfulness, and at cost and pains with us to make us fruitful, which under the first Doctrine hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Because we owe God much fruit for his care and bounty, and our branches are few and small, our bole little, our sap less, and we are able to bring forth but a little fruit at once; besides that the time allotted us for fruit-bearing is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:180407:72"/> short: the furrows had need be bringing forth fruit continually. We have much work for God to do, and but a little time to do it in, and are able to do very little at once, therefore it is requisite we be alwayes working, else we cannot abound in the work of God, and finish that task he hath set us to do. By bearing fruit dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we shall attain at length to fill up the measure of our fruits, and so finish our course with joy, and receive a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When we think we have done all, God may have more and new work for us to do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Old age should abound in ripe fruits, because that is <hi>mellow age,</hi> and hath advantages above youth, as,
<list>
                        <item>1. Large Experience what it is to bring forth fruits, and what either hinders or furthers the same, that may teach them the art of fruit-bearing.</item>
                        <item>2. Long time, to take deep roots downwards, to shoot forth many and great boughs upward, and to suck in abundance of juice and sap from Christ.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see then, that God may justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his people to be constantly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:180407:72"/> even to the end of their lives; and he hath no less graciously promised to make them so, as here: so in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.73, 74, 75. where we read of his Oath, <hi>That he would grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the dayes of our life.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> assures the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> upon the score of Gods faithfulness, that God would sanctifie them wholly, and preserve their whole Spirit, soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.23. See the like in 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it untill the day of Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now God will render his servants, continually, perpetually fruitful (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such as continually depend on him on that account) for these Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To shew the energy and power of his Grace (that vital and fructifying prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the soul) which is much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in maintaining a constancy of fruit-bearing, and that even in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and coldest, the sharpest and most unfavourable seasons, notwithstanding all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:180407:73"/> hinderances, difficulties, disadvantages, even in the raging heat of persecution, the nipping blasts of temptation or other afflictions, and the dead time of old age, when the strength and vigour of nature fails, and its fruitfulness ceaseth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To bring the more honour to his own name, <hi>John</hi> 15.8. The more fruit, the more glory; the more and longer his people abound in good works, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er honour redounds to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. whereas it would be no little dishonour to that great Husbandman (as he is styled <hi>John</hi> 15.1.) if his choice plants, which he hath separated from others, and so much sets by, should prove barren and cease to bear fruit: This might ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect either upon his skill or his care. Therefore, he having fruitfulness at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, will be ever ready to advance it in them, and will not suffer them to dye fruitless.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To manifest the constancy of his love to them, which fades not with time, decayes not with age. God loves them to the end, and because he doth so, and that it may appear he doth so, he will make them fruitful to the end. His ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection to his people of old, moved
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:180407:73"/> him to be the same to them in old age that he had been afore-time, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them even to hoary hairs, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.4. Gods care and regard to the righteous doth not decline with their years. They shall have not only the <hi>former,</hi> but the <hi>latter rain</hi> of Gods Grace and blessing to make them fructifie, and be green even when gray, and their souls fat and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, even when their bodies are like a dry Tree, wizzened and hollow with age.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To fit them for Heaven. For God doth but nurse up the plants of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in his Courts, Garden, or Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard here, to prepare them for that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of God. Now they will not be fit for that excellent soil, if they be not fruitful till, and at their remove. For their bringing forth good fruits, is the condition of and preparative to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing transplanted thither. So that if God should not be ready to further them therein, and to afford requisite sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, he should be wanting to that great design he hath in the world, the fitting of his chosen for Heaven, and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to it.</p>
                  <p>More Reasons might be added, but I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:180407:74"/> shall now subjoyn the Application.</p>
                  <p>Must those that are planted in Gods House, that enjoy means of Grace, be fruitful still, and even when old, then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> I. This reproves three sorts of persons,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that have not yet begun to bear fruits (fruits of repentance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) though they have lived long under the Ordinances: only they resolve to do it hereafter; their time of fruit-bearing is not yet come. Let such,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Compare their case with that of the barren fig-tree, when Christ came to look for fruit from it, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.13. <hi>Its time of fruit was not yet.</hi> The time that it should have brought forth fruit was come, but not the time that it did bring forth. In procrastinating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring your repentance and amendment of life, you in effect say, my time of fruit is not yet, as the people in <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai's</hi> time said, <hi>The time is not come, that the Lords House should be built, Hag.</hi> 1.2. But take heed, lest, as the time was come and gone that God had set for the fig-tree to bear fruit in, so the space al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted you for fruit-bearing be near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:180407:74"/>2. Consider, that though you deferr growing strict and holy till a further time, and think you may do it soon enough hereafter: yet Christ may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by a curse of barrenness, yea, by a sentence of destruction, between your resolutions and the execution of them: because you have been barren so long, and could not find time all this while to bear any fruits, therefore never fruits grow on you hereafter, no not when you have a purpose to be fruitful, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.19. And what follows next, but <hi>Cut them down, why cumber they the ground?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those that have brought forth some fruits formerly, but desist. They for a time seemed zealous, forward, strict, reformed much, did many things; but afterwards lose their temper, leave their strictness, grow carnal in Spirit, loose in carriage, negligent in duties, or what they do that is good, its but by fits, when wakened by afflictions, or some quickning Sermon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but afterwards they cool, wither, sit still. Let such consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That such fickleness in duties is the high-way to fall to flat barrenness at
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:180407:75"/> length. Unsetledness in good duties indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposeth to fruitfulness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Christ come to seek fruit from you (as he did to the fig-tree whilest barren) at such a time whilest you have only leaves on you, what may you fear but the curse of barrenness and doom of cutting down.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is the way to be twice dead, (once before your profession, and since by your declension) and so pluckt up by the roots, <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you leave off fructifying now, you lose all you have done, John Ep. 2.8. 2 Pet. 2.21. <hi>It had been better for you not to have known the way of righteousness, than after you have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let such as were forward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors in their younger years, but are barren, sapless, withered in old age, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in their affections, charity, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, grown worldly, covetous, idle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let such consider, if old age be not the next condition to the Grave, and if they would not go to Heaven out of this part of their lives, and if they ought not then to labour to be such in it, as that they might with comfort depart this life out

And must they not (will they, nill they) go to judgement out of it; and what will they answer to God, if they be barren in it? They must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him for all their works, even in old age, and the Apostle prescribes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the aged in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2, 3.</p>

                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> II. This calls on the people of God to look that they be constantly fruitfull, and maintain holiness and righteousness to the end of their lives. Urge God with his promises in this respect; the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which is to be expected in the way of dependance and diligence. God will make his people fruitful: but they must apply themselves to him and wait on him to receive his fructifying influences; and take heed of sin, which may stop the passage, and obstruct the reception of them.</p>

                  <p>Let this be our daily exercise to keep a Conscience void of offence both towards God and man; this our incessant care and endeavour that none of the following part of our lives prove unfruitful;<note place="margin">Job. 27.5, 6.</note> that all the while our breath is in us, we hold fast our righteousness, and remove not our integrity from us; that when we come to be <hi>full of dayes,</hi> we may be <hi>full of grace and good works,</hi> which will be a great honour to us: <hi>For; The hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness,</hi> Prov. 16.31.

From that matchless <hi>act of grace,</hi> the sending of his Son into the World, that in him he might bless us with all spiritual blessings; and consequently with grace.

Therefore he will give that grace which shall purifie, and render disposed to, and fruitfull in good works. Which is further evident from those earnest and importunate invitations of all that desire it to come to him for it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From his promising and actual giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>the spirit of grace</hi> to his people,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.27. Luk. 11.13. 1 Joh. 4.13.</note> whose business it is to work grace in their hearts, and to strengthen it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.16. Hence Grace is called <hi>the fruit of the spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. Ephes. 5.9. and <hi>the supply of the spirit,</hi> Phil. 1.19. which that it may be continued, the spirit is given to <hi>abide</hi> and <hi>dwell</hi> with the children of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From his affording them <hi>the means of Grace,</hi> which are chiefly designed for their benefit and advantage: For though others also live under them, yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal efficacy and blessing of them is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the righteous only. Christ gave his Ministers, and so his Ordinances, of which they are the dispensers, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints, for the edifying of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:180407:78"/> the body of Christ, <hi>&amp;c. Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>If it be now inquired, why God will make his people fat in Grace, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they may be fruitful in service and obedience. The sap of grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces and nourishes the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. The branches that abide in the true Vine, shall be replenished with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual juice, that they may yield such Wine as may chear God and man: that they may be instrumental for Gods honour and others good. The fuller the heart is of grace, the more the life is filled with good actions. For out of the abundance of the heart, the eye looks, the mouth speaks, and the hand acts. Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture works according to that quality, which is the immediate principle of its action or motion; and it works more, or less according to the degree of its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as it is weaker or stronger. So sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures, men unrenewed act or move in sinful wayes according to the evil quality or bias of sin and corruption, that is in their natures; and the more sin is in their hearts, the more do their lives abound with transgressions. The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:180407:78"/> also, or new-creatures act or move in Gods wayes according to and by the grace of God, infused into and inherent in their hearts, God concurring with them by his assisting grace. And the more this sanctifying saving grace abounds in the soul, the stronger is the principle or stream of spiritual life, and action in them (which is continually fed from Christ the fountain of it) and the more service and obedience do they put forth in their lives. 2 Pet. 1.8. <hi>If these things</hi> (that is, these graces named immediately before) <hi>be in you and abound, they make you, that ye shall neither be barren nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> If you be fat in grace, you will not be spare in duties: If juicefull in holiness then fruitfull in obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only that they <hi>may be full of fruits,</hi> but also that their <hi>fruits may be full.</hi> When the Tree is full of sap, the apples that grow on it are full of juice: so when the heart is full of grace, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it performs are full of savoury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes and a sweet scent. Fat souls make fat sacrifices, fat services.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God will bestow on his people the fatness of grace, to bring them thereby
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180407:79"/> to their fullness of stature in Christ: to which they attain by grace, as trees by sap grow up to their appointed height; and bodies by their juices to their proper tallness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To shew that the Lord is upright in his dealings with the righteous and wicked, notwithstanding the seeming inequality of them: suffering the wicked to spring up as the grass,<note place="margin">Psal. 92.7. &amp; 37.35.</note> to wax fat and shine, to be in great power, and spread themselves like a green Bay-tree; whilest the righteous are in a dry, barren, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered estate in respect of their outward man, often lying under Gods stroaks. This is the Lords doing, these are his wayes, and they are equal too, if we take his dispensations towards the souls of his servants into the account. God makes the souls of his people fat in grace (which is the rarest endowment in the world, and the chiefest beauty of the most glorious creatures God ever made, Angels and men) whilest he makes their outward man to be lank and lean. On the contrary, he feeds the bodies of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men fat with grease, fills their coffers with evidences, their purses with gold and silver, their barns with corn, their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180407:79"/> grounds with cattel; but withall sends leanness into their souls, which makes them like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine ill-favoured, or like his seven thin ears of corn blasted with the East wind; which is a great soul plague. So that if we compare what God doth for the souls of the righteous with what he doth for the bodies of the wicked, and ballance both together in sound judgement, we shall find the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to counter-poise, yea to weigh down the latter. Therefore the fatter any Christian is in grace, the fuller of it, the more fully doth he set forth to the view of the world the uprightness of Gods dealings. And the leaner we are in grace, the more we expose Gods wayes and dispensations towards his people to the censure of inequality and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
                  <p>For these reasons God will make his people fat in grace; and for the same reasons they ought earnestly to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour so to be: which they are further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to, not only by Gods commands of growing in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holiness in Gods fear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and the like, but also by that rich and liberal provision God hath made for this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180407:80"/> purpose, by the sending of his Son, the offers of his grace and spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been before declared, which highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and strongly ingage to labour after this fatness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> I. Then those are lyable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof that profess themselves the people of God, and yet are <hi>sapless</hi> or lean in grace, when God hath made so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision whereby they might grow fat therein. Certainly you do not duly seek out for it, are not careful to fetch it in. Surely you ply not <hi>the Throne of grace</hi> with fervent prayers; you rely not on <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of grace</hi> with a stedfast faith; you improve not <hi>opportunities of grace</hi> with an earnest diligence; you maintain not close communion with the Father and the Son <hi>the fountain of all grace,</hi> and do not duly cherish the motions of <hi>the spirit of grace.</hi> God hath made sufficient preparation for your thriving, and invites you to, and is ready to dispense what is necessary and conducive thereto, and you neglect it. He will not be a barren wilderness to his people, nor as waters that fail; but if you do not constantly apply your selves to him, no wonder if your root be dry, and you want this spiritual juice. Or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180407:80"/> you may instead of it, be full of sinful humours, worldliness, pride, passion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very poyson and venom of the old Serpent.</p>
                  <p>The more to promote your humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this spiritual leanness, or saples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To what end God hath planted you in his house, and given you so long to enjoy the plentiful means of spiritual nourishment? To what end hath God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded you Sabbath-dayes and Lecture-dayes, besides other pretious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities by the by? To what end did he continue you under the means of Grace so many years, and made you such feasts of fat things? was it not that hereby you might grow fat in Grace, full of faith, love, meekness, holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How will you look God in the face when the account-day comes, if notwithstanding these means, you be still poor and ill-liking. You know how ill-favoured <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine lookt, when they had eaten up the seven well favoured fat Kine, they were never the fuller, it could not be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ill-favoured as at the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.3, 21. Such
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:180407:81"/> ill-favoured, ill-looking Creatures in Gods sight are all lean Christians, who have lived under a faithful and painful Ministry, heard many excellent Sermons, eaten many fat Ordinances, Word and Sacraments, and yet are never the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but remain starvelings still, and as poor in respect of faith, self-denyal, humbleness, the power of godliness and a throughout reformation in their spirits and courses, as before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider that you are a disgrace to the House of God, that fat soil you are planted in, to the Ordinances you have lived so long under, to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Gods Stewards that have brought you your appointed food from God dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feed your souls fat in Grace. By your leanness you in effect proclaim to the world, that these are barren, dry, sapless things, and of no spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment. Further, you shame the body of Christ (if you be members of it) for disproportion in members, when some are very fat, others very lean is a great deformity. The head of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful body is fat, and so are your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members fat in Grace, and if you be lean, how do you disgrace it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:180407:81"/>3. You must needs be barren in good works, whilest you want that juice of Grace that should feed the fruits of well-doing: without it you will be dry and withered. If you be sapless in your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits you will be fruitless in your lives. And,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You will be but dwarfs and shrubs in Christianity. Your leanness will cause lowness in spiritual stature. If you be not full of spiritual juice you cannot fill up your due dimensions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You would have all fat that you keep, because things are commonly of most worth and use when fat: And can you be content your souls, which are the chief part of you, should be lean. Is it not a trouble to see your children lean and ill-liking, notwithstanding they eat and drink of the best daily, and your Cattel ill-liking though they be well kept? And is it no grief to you to see how plentifully you are fed with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly food, and how ill you look and thrive? May not many a mans Cattel shame him in that when he hath put them into good Grass, they have fed fat in a short time: whereas God hath put him into the green pastures of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:180407:82"/> it may be as many years as his Cattel grazed moneths, and yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues lean still: Yea, may not many mens bodies rise up to condemn their souls, in that they grew fat soon: When as their poor souls feed not at all, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it may be their bodily diet hath been but spare and mean, and that of their soul more full and dainty.</p>
                  <p>Search this matter to the bottom, and be deeply humbled for it. And let us all see whether we have not some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to take up that lamentation, <hi>my lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 24.16.</note>
                     <hi>my leanness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> II. Hence poor Christians may take comfort, though they have not with <hi>Esau,</hi> the fatness of the Earth to their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither fat ground, nor fat Cattel, nor fat estates, nor fat bodies, yet they may have fat souls, which is the best of all, much excelling all the former. For as the fat is the best of every thing, so Grace is the best of all fat. Its far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a soul fat with Grace, than a body fat with grease; or an estate with goods. For fatness sometimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figures and mishapes the body, and spoils its features, and it renders less disposed to and unfit for action. And the fatness
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:180407:82"/> of wealth often causeth forgetfulness of God, yea, backsliding from him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.20. &amp; 32.15. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.25, 26.<note place="margin">Psal. 78.31. Job 15 21. with 27.</note> Besides that the fat-backs of the world are often the people of Gods wrath, Jer. 5.27, 28, 29. <hi>Their houses are full of deceit, therefore they are become great and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they over-pass the deeds of the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall not my soul be avenged of such a Nation as this?</hi> God threatens that <hi>Chaldea</hi> should be a spoil, and <hi>Babylon</hi> not inhabited, and gives the reason in those words, <hi>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoyced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat, as the Heifer at grass,</hi> Jer. 50.9, 10, 11, 13. And even amongst his own people he threatens to <hi>destroy the fat and the strong,</hi> Ezek. 34.16. that is, the Shepheards (whether Civil or Ecclesiastical, or both) who fed themselves, but fed not the flock, yea, who ruled with force and violence, and enriched themselves by making a prey of the flock, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 10. But the fatness of Grace is the greatest Ornament and beauty of the soul: which the more it grows therein, the more it comes into the fashion of Heaven, into
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180407:83"/> the likeness of God. This makes men mindful of God, carefull to stick close to him, fearful to depart from him, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry active and stirring in all manner of well-doing. And those that have it are the people of Gods love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> III. Then let us examine whether we have this spiritual fatness. This might be discerned by the signs of bodily fatness. When the body grows fat, then the cloaths are made bigger, the girdle is let out, the body is heavier, and it sweats much, and the man commonly is merry. So when the soul grows fat, <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> which is the habit or <hi>clothing</hi> of it, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.) is enlarged: <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>truth</hi> in the inward parts, wherewith the loyns of our minds are <hi>girt about, Ephes.</hi> 6.14. is more drawn out; a sign the New-creature in us is grown into a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger compass, and takes up a greater room. And then <hi>Faith,</hi> according to which God reckons the <hi>weight</hi> of the soul, is increased. <hi>Good works</hi> and holy duties, which are the <hi>sweat</hi> of this soul-fat, are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, or the man sweats more, is more intent and fervent in them. And his soul rejoyces more in the Lord, and in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:180407:83"/> his service, and in the communion of Saints.</p>
                  <p>But to keep close to the Metaphor in the Text, taken from Trees, we may from the signs of their fatness discover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our souls be fat with Grace. The Trees fatness or sappiness appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From their much weeping, and the plenty of tears (so their juice is called) which they send forth when cut or pierced. So the fatness of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous may be gathered from their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exercise of repentance and godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, issuing from them even for the least sin and their secret failings; from their being cut to the heart with a kindly sense of their provocations, which makes frequent confessions of their own vileness drop from them. When reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods goodness to them, so pierceth their hearts as to give a plentiful vent to their tears, or at least to their grief, for what offends him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fulness of sap in Trees appears by their pliantness, for the more sap they have, the more easie they are to be bowed any way. So the more Grace the more compliance with the will of God, the more inclinableness to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180407:84"/> and the more submission to and under his hand: the more is the mind ready to his service, the will bowed to his pleasure, the affections bent that way he would have them, the heart affected with his word and providential dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and the man humble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sappiness in Trees may be argued from their weightiness, for they are much heavier when green, than when dry. Faith is the weight of the soul which makes it tend towards Christ as its Center, and the more faith it hath, the more ponderous it is, the harder doth it lean upon God, and the more doth it press him with his promises: the mind is more staid upon him, the heart more fixed, the man more stedfast and hard to be removed from his ground. <hi>They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>which cannot be removed, Psal.</hi> 125.1. Faith makes the Christian as heavy as a Mountain.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Spreading much is an evidence of much sap; for Trees replenished with it, are ever either increasing their bulk, or putting forth either roots, or shoots, or buds, or leaves, or blossoms, or fruits. So where there is much Grace there will
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180407:84"/> be much spiritual activity. This sap will be breaking forth into a verdant profession, into a fruitful practice, into savoury discourse, and be sending many shoots upwards, holy ejaculations, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thoughts, desires, prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Withal, making the soul better rooted in the truths and wayes of God. And the more Grace, the more of these Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p>Object. But here some may object, <hi>I do not grow fat in Grace, but rather find a decay therein, a deadness in my Spirit, a coolness in my affections, I am not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to duties; I have not those spiritual feelings, comforts, enlargements, vigours which I formerly had: I am more straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and damp'd in my soul to all good now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It may be thou art not so diligent in the use of Means, especially in private, close walking with God: not so watchful over thy Spirit and wayes to order all by rule, as formerly; but more careless of thy carriage, more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in duties. Thou art poor in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, therefore not rich in Grace: Eatest little spiritual meat, therefore gettest little spiritual strength, growest
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:180407:85"/> not fat. And in this case thy not grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fat is thy own fault. Be humbled for it and amend, and to that purpose follow the directions set down in the next Use.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Know that a Christian may grow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In Stability</hi> and setledness in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate estate, he may grow more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and stedfast in his Spirit and course, in his judgement and practice: more rooted and established in the truths and wayes of God: and,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He may grow <hi>in the exercise of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Graces;</hi> as self-denyal, faith, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, meekness, humility, sincerity; and in the intrinsecal or inmost acts of these and other Graces; though he slourish and abound not so much in the outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties, and in shews &amp; osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Graces as formerly; He may grow in self-denyal as to things that are greatest hearts desires and eyes delights, as to great parts and glorious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and the reputation of spiritual gifts and abilities. He may encrease in faith, believing against hope, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after, and cleaving to God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all repulses and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. He may grow in patience
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:180407:85"/> and constancy in enduring great fights of affliction, whilest he is able to bear and suffer more, though he find himself able to do less. He may grow more content to be abased, and not to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of others, and may be more thankful for what measure of gifts, grace, strength and comfort the Lord pleaseth to allot him, though to his thinking he receive less from God now than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He may grow in that Grace of humility, whilest he grows more vile and sinful in his own eyes: and he that grows in that Grace, grows in all the rest. Upon which account it may be that a Christian may grow fatter when to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he rather seems to fall away, or to grow more dry and sapless; he may have more Grace, when he thinks he hath less. He may look more inward now, and to the carriage of his heart in duties; though he be not so much in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal performance as sometime formerly. He may be more strong to resist corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and temptations, though more strongly tempted to sin, and to more sins now than before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He may grow in <hi>Experience</hi> of Gods dealings with the soul, of the work of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:180407:86"/> grace in the heart, of the contrariety and combate between the spirit and flesh, and of the variety of soul-states, through which it pleaseth God to carry his children: and so be more able to speak of such things, and to advise others from experience, though he be not so tongue-ripe, so forward to speak and so full of words, and have not those joys and ravishments, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He may grow in the <hi>substance, pith and solidity, in the mellowness, and ripeness of affections and actions:</hi> which may be more solid and savoury, though not so bulky and eyly; though they seem not so big or so beautiful, but lye in a less room now than formerly. Part of a Christians affections at first upon his Conversion springs from the newness of his state, and so may cease when that state or condition ceaseth to be new to him: and yet afterwards he may love God and spiritual things as <hi>truly</hi> and happily, more <hi>rationally,</hi> though not so <hi>passionately,</hi> as at first. His du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be better seasoned with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and humility, though not so larded (as sometimes) with inlargements and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:180407:86"/> stirring affections. There is less of his own spirit now in duties and more of Gods spirit and grace; and therefore his duties now seem far less in his own eyes than they did formerly, when they were more full of froth. His duties may be more cordial, though less corporal, oral, gestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He may not so multiply religious performances as heretofore, and yet may walk more regularly, by minding other duties also, relating to his calling and station in the world, which he before neglected. Or he may spend less time in the exercises of Godliness, because he hath not such opportunities, nor that leisure he had before, by reason of the change of his condition, and new employment God hath called him to, and yet he may be still in the discharge of his duty as much as before, though in part the kind be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Consider that there are some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial seasons, in which God bestows a greater measure of assistance, grace and comfort than he is pleased to give at other times; as upon conversion, or when he calls to special service, or to great suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings or tryals. His communications
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180407:87"/> are then extraordinary, because the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition and exigencies of his servants are extraordinary: but when these are over, he reduceth them to their ordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. Yea the case may be such as that God may suffer the blossoms of joy to wither, that the fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may appear the better, that grace may be clearlier seen and grow more. For sometimes grace puts forth more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously when comfort falls off.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Mistake not a decay of gifts or of nature for a decay of grace. Part of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liveliness and enlargement might arise from gifts and parts, or from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral strength and vigour, and so may fail with these, through age, bodily weakness and distempers, and yet grace not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. The disposition of heart may be the same, though, through indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body, it cannot express and shew it self as formerly. The soul may be fat when the body wastes and is too fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and destitute of spirits to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in gracious employments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> IV. Then let all be exhorted to get and keep this spiritual fat, being like the Olive in <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.9. that <hi>would not leave his fatness.</hi> Labour to be full of this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:180407:87"/> spiritual juice: and to that end make use of these ensuing means.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Drink in the water of life.<note place="margin">Means.</note> The more water Herbs and Trees enjoy, the more are they replenished with sap. And as in the sap is the life of the plant; so in grace stands the life of the soul. Therefore its well call'd in Scripture <hi>Water of life;</hi> Christ is the fountain of it, and there's a fullness in him, and its freely offered to such as sincerely desire it. Such may take their fill of it, they may have it for coming for, for receiving it, yea and may have abundance. Rev. 21.6. <hi>I will give unto him that is a-thirst, of the fountain of the water of life freely.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> Joh. 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> Where by <hi>life</hi> understand grace, which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life. Enlarge therefore your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and take freely what's freely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Christ. Be still coming for more, for <hi>he gives liberally.</hi>

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:180407:88"/>2. Suck in the fatness of Gods house.

Here are his Ordinances dispenst; those <hi>feasts of fat things</hi> full of Marrow, and of Wines on the Lees well refined, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.6. They are full of juice and spiritual nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore suck here and be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Attend duly on the Word. For this is a means of growth, 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>Christs words are spirit and life,</hi> Joh. 6.63. The Word of God is that to the soul, which rain and snow are to plants, which as they, by filling Herbs and Trees with sap, make them bud and bear fruit: so shall Gods Word in like manner make the souls of his people (that thirst after it) prosper: <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.10, 11. Therefore Christ thus bespeaks them: <hi>Hearken diligently to me, and let your soul delight it self in fatness. Incline your eare and come
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:180407:88"/> unto me, hear and your soul shall live,</hi> verse 2, 3.</item>
                     <item>2. Improve Sacraments; where you have the flesh and blood of Christ to feed on, the most excellent and most nourishing food, by which the plants that are round about Gods Table may prosper much, as Trees do by blood and flesh put to their roots.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="3">3. Pray earnestly, as for your selves, so for your Ministers; that God would <hi>satiate their souls with fatness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 31.14.</note> then he will by them satisfie your souls with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Your portion will then be fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who are to be fed by them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Meditate seriously of God day and night. See <hi>Davids</hi> sense of this course in Psal. 63.5, 6. <hi>My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness: and my mouth shall praise thee with joyfull lips: when I remember thee on my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Be liberal both in temporals and in spirituals unto others; for <hi>the liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself,</hi> Prov. 11.25.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Be diligent in the use of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Means: and also in the exercise of

And to him that employs what he hath, as they in the Parable did their Talents, shall more be given, and he shall have abundance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. For, as it is in Plants, the more sap they expend in leaves and fruits, the more still they receive from the root; So here the more grace is put forth, the more still will flow in to the soul from Christ.</p>
                  <p>So much may suffice to have spoken of the fatness of the righteous (those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly plants) their greenness follows to be treated of.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> IV. <hi>God will have the plants in his house to be green.</hi> So was <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 52.8. <hi>I am like a green Olive Tree in the house of God.</hi> Hence the godly are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared also to the <hi>Palm-tree, Psal.</hi> 92.12. the branches whereof are fair and green continually.

Ezek. 41.20.</note> And the walls of the Temple were carved with Palm-trees, to shew the flourishing state of those that are

<list>
                        <item>1. Green is the best colour of Trees and Herbs. It arayes and adorns them; makes them look fresh and comely.</item>
                        <item>2. Its the colour of Trees when they are at best in themselves, (full of sap all over and full of fruit) and at the best time of the year, in the spring and Summer. For in Winter, when spoiled of their gay green garment, they look gray and withered.</item>
                        <item>3. This colour is natural to them, even according to their kind, and it grows out from them, they have the cause thereof in themselves. Trees are not dyed green by art, but grow green by nature.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the greenness of the righteous appears in their profession, conversation, and consolation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are green <hi>in profession,</hi> when they constantly hold forth the Word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. the Religion they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, the truths of God they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of; the wayes of God they walk in,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180407:90"/> their faith in Christ, and sense of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things: seeming to the World to be all that, and only that which they are in themselves; not being ashamed of Christ, nor of the Gospel of Christ before men. They are green, who hold forth that in a bold, undaunted profession, which they are in judgement and practice, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and affection touching God, his things and wayes. As <hi>David</hi> did, Psal. 119.46. <hi>I will speak of thy Testimonies also before Kings: and will not be ashamed.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 24.14. <hi>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so worship I the God of my Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their greenness appears in their <hi>beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> or <hi>conversation,</hi> when they strive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to express and shew forth the vertues of him who hath called them; and endeavour that all their actions may have the gloss and lustre of grace and holiness upon them. When the carriage of the whole man (spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and body) in their places, and all the relations they stand in to others in family or any other society, and in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and dealings with others, is such as becomes the Gospel, as may represent
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180407:90"/> the beauty and amiableness of Religion when they walk wisely and humbly,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.15. Jam. 3 13.</note> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly or exactly: <hi>shewing out of a good conversation their works with meekness of wisdom:</hi> Then are they green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, fair and resplendent. For <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (that wisdom from above which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without wavering and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocrisie, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. that) <hi>makes the face to shine,</hi> Eccles. 8.1. as it did <hi>Josephs</hi> in the eyes of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels,</hi> so as to draw great respect from <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Darius.</hi> How did <hi>Job's</hi> righteousness make his glory to be fresh in him? <hi>Job</hi> 29.11, 13, 14, 20. How amiable and illustrious did it render him?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their greenness appears in their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> when they have inward refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, peace of conscience, evidences cleared, minds stayed upon God, hearts fixed trusting in him: but more especially at such times, when God causeth his face to shine upon them in a more eminent manner, and warms their hearts with the plentiful beams of his love shed abroad there, and pours the oyle of joy and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:180407:91"/> gladness into their souls. How do they flourish then? how fresh and chearful, how lively and lovely doth their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure grow? Yet remember, that comfort is not absolutely necessary to the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or being of the colour of the righteous; (they may carry a green in profession and conversation, only it will be sadder without it) but it is requisite to the bettering thereof, to make it more sweet and amiable, more lightsome and pleasant. And then are they in their best state.</p>
                  <p>The Greenness of the godly is natural and continual.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is natural to them, as they are the planting of the Lord, it being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of their Grace put forth into act, (as that of Trees is of their sap when displayed in leaves) and the more they have of the Sun-shine of Gods favour, the clearer and brighter it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is continual: It is to last all the year, and all their lives long. It is not determined to any particular seasons, but is to be retained, not only in the spring and temperate seasons of youth, peace and prosperity: but also,

                  <p>So you have seen the properties of their verdure.

                  <p>Now that it is the duty of those that are set in Gods Courts to be ever green, may be made evident from those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are before set down to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their fruitfulness. And that God is willing and ready to make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so, may appear from the promises he hath made of what is conducive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite thereto.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Dew and showers of Heaven,</hi> Hos. 14.5, 6. <hi>I will be as the dew to Israel, and his beauty shall be as the Olive-tree,</hi> called a <hi>goodly Tree, Lev.</hi> 23.40. compared with <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.15. And that not only for its fruitfulness, but its constant greenness, even in the midst of Winter. It looks fresh and eyly, when many other Trees are deformed and withered. In <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.6, 7. It is prophesied, that Christ should <hi>come down like rain upon the morning grass; as showers that water the earth: In his dayes shall the righteous flourish so long as the Moon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180407:93"/> endures,</hi> that is, during his whole reign, even to the worlds end. What quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and reviving, what freshness and Beauty, Gardens, Fields, Vineyards and Orchards receive from dew and rain falling on them, the like will God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his Vineyard, Christ to his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the plants therein, and that by the showers of his Grace and blessing, the droppings of his Word, and the pouring out of his Spirit. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is considerable what we read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.12. <hi>By the River</hi> (issuing from the House of God, <hi>v.</hi> 1.) <hi>upon the bank thereof, on this side, and on that side, shall grow Trees whose leaf shall be for medicine, and shall not fade; neither shall the fruit (which shall be for meat) be consumed, but be new according to the Moneths, because their waters issued out of the Sanctuary.</hi> Where it is most probable, that the Waters or River shadow forth the dispensation of the Gospel, and of the Ordinances of Christ, or the effusion of spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.18. And that the Trees represent the faithful that are planted in the Church of Christ, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Ordinances. These spread their root by the waters, and the dew lyes on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180407:94"/> their branch: yea, they are rooted in Christ the fountain of living waters, therefore their leaf shall not wither: For he hath promised, the water they receive from him, shall be in them <hi>a Well of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter springing up into everlasting life,</hi> John 4.14. Where his Spirit and Grace are to be understood by water: which will make them <hi>semper viveacs,</hi> alwayes green. <hi>They shall never thirst;</hi> that is, never see drought, never want, their water shall not fail; even that water of life, which can turn a soul that is like a dry and parched Heath into a Paradise. Hence Christ calls his Spouse <hi>a Garden inclosed,</hi> (made such by Grace of a desart by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>a spring shut up,</hi> and <hi>a fountain sealed,</hi> that is, well secured and preserved, pure and perennous, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.15. The righteous shall be <hi>as a well-watered Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 58.11.</note>
                     <hi>and like a spring of water, whose wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fail not.</hi> Like a Garden well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, in which all things put forth, and are in their beauty and flourish, and may constantly maintain their verdure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath promised to be <hi>a Sun</hi> to the righteous, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. and that to them (Christ) <hi>the Sun of Righteousness shall arise, Mal.</hi> 4.2. to illuminate, enliven,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:180407:94"/> rejoyce them: to impart to them his quickning heat and cheering light, his encouraging and refreshing influences, his powerful assistance, and the comforts of his presence: whereby life and vigour are infused into the soul, grace springs in the heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oliness flourisheth in the life. The mouth confesses God and is filled with his praises, the man walks more worthy of God. And as Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the Spring, when the Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, sprout up, disclose and open themselves, and appear in their gayest colours: So all holy endowments, when God thus shines upon him, will shew themselves in the most lovely plight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> I. If God have thus provided that his people may be green and flourishing, then let them look to it that they be so. Let them get the true and the liveliest colour of grace upon their spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and upon their whole demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Which that you may be the more effectually induced to; consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby you will resemble Christ, who is called a <hi>green tree,</hi> Luke 23.31. <hi>an Olive-tree,</hi> Rom. 11.17. (as God calls himself <hi>a green Fir-tree,</hi> Hos. 14.8.) his branches therefore must not be dry and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:180407:95"/> withered, then they will be unsuitable and uncomely, a disgrace and dishonour to him. As Christ is termed a <hi>righteous branch,</hi> Jer. 23.5. <hi>A sprig from the root of</hi> Jesse, <hi>upon whom was the Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Knowledge, and the fear of the Lord,</hi> Isa. 11.1, 2. And <hi>in whom he was glorified,</hi> John 17.4. So it is prophesied of those that belong to him, that they <hi>shall be Trees of Righteousness,</hi> and by their thrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flourishing appear to be <hi>the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord</hi> (or <hi>the branch of his plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as it is Isa. 60.21.) <hi>that he might be glorified,</hi> Isa. 61.3. As Christ did alwayes those things that pleased his Father, <hi>John</hi> 8.29. So Christians should walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26.</note>
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. He was <hi>holy, harmless, undefiled, the light of the world,</hi> and that not only by his Doctrine, but also by his example. So must you also be <hi>holy as he is holy, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and harmless, the sons of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, shining as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation,</hi> Phil. 2.15. <hi>Consider him who endured such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of sinners against himself, lest you be weary and faint in your minds,</hi> Heb. 12.3. Consider this Apostle and High Priest of our Profession, who came into
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:180407:95"/> the world that he might bear witness to the truth, and before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed a good confession: And that you may be like him, abide in the truth, and hold fast the profession of your faith without wavering.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As being green is an evidence both of a vegetative life, and of a spring estate, that the Tree both lives and grows; whereas being withered argues that it is dead, or wintered at least: So when Christians are green in their profession and practice, have the lustre of grace and holiness upon their spirits and wayes, then they declare plainly that they are alive to God, yea, that it is spring time with them, and that they grow in grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This will most beautifie and set you forth, as Trees are most spruce and fine, when arrayed and deckt with green leaves. How amiable and lovely doth a prudent, meek, humble, graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the conversation make many a man and woman upon whom nature hath bestowed little cost to make them fair or comely? That carriage which adorns the Gospel, will be your greatest ornament: that which becomes godliness
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:180407:96"/> will be your comeliness. Such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment as God is most honoured by in the eyes of men will be your greatest honour. To suffer for well-doing and yet patiently to continue therein, and not change colour for all the weather-beating of persecution, is illustrious and glorious. If you suffer as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and be reproached for the name of Christ, and endure it with meekness: <hi>the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.20, 21, 23. &amp; 4.14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This will yield pleasure and delight both to God and man. For as green is a very pleasant colour to look on, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting and recreating the eye, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and strengthening the sight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those creatures which are the most common objects of the eye, as grass, hearbs, trees, are so framed as to be of that colour, as also is the <hi>Emerald</hi> that goodly and precious Stone, which so sweetly entertains the eye without ever glutting it: And for weak and sore eyes green is of all colours the most relieving and refreshing: So is a verdant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fadeing, a lively and chearful profession and practice of Religion endued with the like qualities: for,
<list>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:180407:96"/>
                        <item>1. It much takes and highly pleases the eye of Christ to look upon it, therefore he delights to be in his Garden and Vineyard,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.2.11.</note> that he may see the Vine flourish, and the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats bud: that he may behold how the precious plants in his Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery the Church do thrive, how green they look, how their graces sprout forth, as well as what good fruits they are bringing to maturity. His Church is his <hi>Eden,</hi> his Garden of pleasure: conversing in which makes him break forth into that excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>How pleasant art thou, O Love, for delights!</hi> Cant. 7.6. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord loveth righteousness, <hi>His countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> Psal. 11.7. <hi>He delighteth in his way,</hi> Psal. 37.23. <hi>He takes pleasure in those that fear him,</hi> Psal. 147.11.</item>
                        <item>2. It is a delightful sight, a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing and rejoycing to the eyes and hearts of the godly, as it was to <hi>John</hi> to find the Elect Ladies Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren walking in truth, Epist. 2.4. <hi>Now we live,</hi> (that is, are much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and cheared) <hi>if ye stand fast in the faith,</hi> said <hi>Paul, Silvanus</hi> and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:180407:97"/>
                           <hi>Timotheus</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians, for what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</hi> namely, for <hi>your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope: having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with joy of the Holy Ghost: so that we were ensamples to all that believe in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.8, 9. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2, 3, 6, 7. Hence the Apostle greatly desired to see them, that he might still have more pleasure in beholding so lovely and delighting objects, with the report of which at a distance he was so much affected, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6. All <hi>Davids</hi> delight was (next to God) in the Saints, the excellent on the earth, <hi>Psalm</hi> 16.3.</item>
                        <item>3. If any have an eye that is weak in discerning the beauty of holiness, and how to walk in the wayes of God; Or if any have a sore or evil eye at Gods people, yet spighting and maligning of them: to look much and often upon the greeness of their paths, the buddings of their
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:180407:97"/> graces, the lovely hiew of their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, may be a means to clear and strengthen the eye of the one, and to amend and cure that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is often made sore by by being fixed only upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing colour of the Saints infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities (where any can be either spyed or fancied) and not at all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that inoffensive and taking one of their piety and constancy. 1 Pet. 2.15. <hi>So is the will of God that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of foolish men?</hi> v. 12.—<hi>that whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they shall behold, glorifie God in the day of visitation:</hi> and Chap. 3.1, 2. <hi>Wives be in subjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the Word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives, while they behold your chaste con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation coupled with fear.</hi> See also v. 16.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If you would have that <hi>inheritance</hi> and <hi>crown of glory which fadeth not away</hi> when you dye, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>and</hi> 5.4. its both suitable and necessary that your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:180407:98"/> and practice of Religion should not fade while you live, You must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the end that you may be saved. You must be faithful unto death, that you may receive a crown of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                  <p>Look well then to your profession and demeanour, that both be such as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may glorifie God, and be a joy yea an honour to the Saints with whom you live in communion: such as may cast a lustre upon the truths of God you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the wayes of God you walk in: such as may in the eyes of all spectators render Religion lovely, yea and grace it self glorious.</p>
                  <p>Remember that the eyes of others are fixed on you, and rather on your <hi>colour</hi> than your <hi>sap.</hi> The men of the World look not so much What you are, as What you shew or seem to be. They frame their apprehensions of Religion by the gloss of your profession and carriage. If those be green and fresh, fair and amiable, it wins their approbation. But if they be sullyed, duskish, sad or withered, it is unpleasing and matter of offence.</p>
                  <p>Yet here take these <hi>cautions</hi> along with you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though you must be green, yet have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:180407:98"/> a care that you do not place all in colour or shew, as Hypocrites do, whose chief study and endeavour is to seem Religious and appear righteous in the eyes of others, rather than to be so in deed and truth; to have a name to live, rather than indeed to be alive to God. Our Saviour sets them out in their colours in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25, 27, 28. They make clean the outside of the Cup and of the Platter, and are like to Sepulchres outwardly beautiful: but within they are full of hypocrisie and iniquity. All their care is to paint their outside, their words and looks and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal behaviour with the colour of piety, that they may have a resemblance of those that are Godly. Like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. they come and sit and hear as the people of God do, but they want sincerity and truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, to be what they seem. A hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is but the voice and hiew, or face of a Christian, without his heart. He is in Christianity like a <hi>Parrot</hi> both for colour and speech; both look green and gay, and both can prattle and talk, but that is all. He hears Gods Word, but will not do it. He may shew much love with his mouth, but his heart goes after
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:180407:99"/> his Covetousness. He hath the colour, but wants the vigour of piety. He hath the form, but wants the power of Godliness. He hath the model of Religion, but not the life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Joyn fatness and fruitfulness with your greenness. God hath put them all together, and you must not put them asunder. He promises all, and requires and expects all these together: And that in this order, first that you be fat in grace (and so fructifie) and then that you be green in shew, in profession and carriage. For this must follow, yea flow from the former: then your colour will be so deep and fixed as not to fade. Hypocrites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the wrong end; they first hang out the bush before there be any juice of the grape within. They are but like artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Trees that are used for garnishing, which are green'd over, but have no life or sap within; or like painted posts, which stand upright, but have neither fruit nor root. If therefore you would approve your selves sincere, see that your leaves of profession issue from the sap of grace, and be accompanied with the fruits of righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let not your <hi>flourish</hi> be above the rate of your <hi>fruitfulness,</hi> nor your shews
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:180407:99"/> exceed your substance. Look to it that you be as good and do as well as you would seem to be and do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> II. Be carefull ever to keep your verdure when you have once got it. Take heed you do not change colour, nor lose your gloss; which may be done se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes, of each of which you must beware, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By backsliding and departure from the wayes of God, in which you have been illightened and walked, into those sinfull courses you have formerly eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This will make you like dead bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cut off, cast forth and fit only for the fire, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 12. Here the profession is quite withered and falls off, and such corruption follows, as makes a loathsome scent in Gods nostrills. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By errours in opinion, which usually darken the profession and practice too, by keeping off that light of truth which else would cast a lustre thereon, when those that have been eminent professors desert the truths they held forth, how doth their former splendour wax dim and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish? how strangely do they look? How sadly was part of the Churches of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:180407:100"/> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> blasted with erroneous doctrines? <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15, 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By dissembling your religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession or practice, or by denying any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth you are in your judgements convinced of, or deserting any way of God, of the rightness of which you are perswaded, for fear of men; and to avoid suffering or disgrace. When men are afraid or ashamed to walk in any truths or wayes of the Gospel, because they are distasted or oppugned, or they may be questioned for it. Christ professes he will be ashamed of such (as ill-looking, for cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardliness appales and deadens the looks, taking away the freshness and vigour thereof) before his Father and all his holy Angels, at the day of his glorious appearing. Even <hi>Peter</hi> began to lose his colour, when he denyed his Master, but he soon by repentance renewed it, and made it fresh again. Those among the Rulers had not attained the right com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of Christianity, who believed on Christ, but because of the Pharisees did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the Synagogue, for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:180407:100"/>4. By leaving your former fervour and forwardness, growing more dull and flat in your spirits, cool in your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remiss in your duties, averse to, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of, slight in them. Which was the case of the Church of <hi>Ephesus who left her first love,</hi> Rev. 2.4. and of <hi>Sardis</hi> who <hi>had a name that she lived, but was dead,</hi> Chap. 3.1. and of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who <hi>was luke-warm and neither cold nor hot,</hi> v. 16. such a decay was there of spiritual life and warmth, of stirring affection and zeal for God, his truths, service and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in those Churches, as made their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour appear faint and much faded in the eyes of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By any sin allowed or indulged, by miscarriage, uncircumspect walking, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by falling into any gross sin. For sin, as it defiles the soul in the sight of God, so, when it is visible, it blots the good name, and soyles and stains the profession in the eyes of men. It is a foul spot and blemish to a righteous man, it discolours him and makes him look unlike himself, which made <hi>David</hi> pray so earnestly to God, after his adultery and murder, to wash him throughly, to cleanse and purge him, to create a clean heart and renew a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:180407:101"/> right spirit in him, and to restore to him the joy of his Salvation, that he might recover his right complexion; that by the reviving of his grace and comfort he might look fair and fresh again.</p>
                  <p>Lusts allowed will be that to your souls which the <hi>locusts</hi> were to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a great plague, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.15. for as they ate up every green thing in the land, so will your lusts do in you; they will not, if you obey them, suffer you to be green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing. Abstain therefore carefully from all sin, yea from the very appearance of evil.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By lumpish, dumpish sadness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by melancholy, heavy, dull, or too austere carriage ordinarily. Hereby a Christian looks rather <hi>black</hi> than <hi>green,</hi> or at best of a very dark and sad green, like Winter, not like spring or summer. He puts (as it were) <hi>mourning weeds</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion, as if to be Religious were the course to be dull, pensive, sad and never lightsome or pleasant more, and so renders it unamiable yea formidable to others, and brings up an ill report by this means of Religion and the wayes of God, which are indeed the springs of all true joy and comfort. Psal. 138.5. <hi>They shall sing in the wayes of the Lord.</hi> For those
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:180407:101"/> wayes <hi>are wayes of pleasantness,</hi> Prov. 3.17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14.17. Hence the righteous are called upon to rejoice, and that made their constant duty. <hi>Be glad in the Lord and rejoyce ye righteous,</hi> Psal. 32.11. and 33.1. Phil. 3.1. <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.16. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, rejoice,</hi> Phil. 4.4. Yea this is required of them in their tribulations, Jam. 1.2. <hi>Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.</hi> Matth. 5.11, 12. <hi>Blessed are ye when men shall revile and persecute you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in Heaven.</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in as much as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings, that when his glory shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</hi> When Christians are of chearful Spirits in their ordinary course, and much more if they can be joyfull in tribulation, they are very amiable, adorn their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and commend their Religion to those that know them, and may draw others to speak well of and embrace it. Whereas a drooping and heavy carriage will discourage them from it. Many were added to the Churches of <hi>Judaea,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:180407:102"/> Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Galilee</hi> when they walked in the fear of the Lord <hi>and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost,</hi> then they were not only <hi>edified</hi> but <hi>multiplyed, Act.</hi> 9.31. Christians <hi>should not let the consolations of God be small with them,</hi> who in giving his Son hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them matter of <hi>everlasting consolation,</hi>

Which should be more studied, that thankfulness might be more promoted, which is a very becoming du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Psal. 33.1. and 147.1. <hi>Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God: for it is pleasant and praise is comely.</hi> Practise it more and you shall have more comfort: And remember, that though Grace give the Righteous their <hi>colour,</hi> yet a holy cheerfulness sets on the <hi>gloss,</hi> and makes it much more pleasant.</p>
                  <p>If then you would keep your <hi>verdure,</hi> take heed it be neither <hi>withered</hi> by apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, <hi>blasted</hi> by errour, <hi>appaled</hi> by cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise, <hi>faint and fading</hi> by remisness, <hi>soyl'd and stain'd</hi> by sin, <hi>dull'd and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd</hi> by sadness and melancholy.</p>
                  <p>If you find your colour any whit changed or decayed, endeavour with all speed to renew it. Take Christs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> who had lost the freshness of theirs: <hi>Remember
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180407:102"/> from whence you are fallen, and repent, and do your first works,</hi> Rev. 2.5, 16. <hi>Be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to dye. Remember how you have received and heard, and hold fast,</hi> and <hi>be zealous,</hi> chap. 3.2, 3, 19. Green (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some) is a colour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>black</hi> and <hi>red.</hi> And if you would have a good dye, and be made green again, you may, by adding to the <hi>sable of repentance</hi> or meltings of the heart into sorrow for your sin, the <hi>red</hi> of <hi>Christs blood</hi> sprinkled thereon by faith. And if you would keep your verdure when you have it, take the following course, which is excellent to prevent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colouring and to maintain the righteous in a green and flourishing state.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Get store of the sap of grace, and to that end use the means before prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the increase thereof. Then plants flourish most, when they most abound with sap. And the more <hi>fatness of grace</hi> the <hi>branches</hi> of the <hi>good Olive</hi> have, the more will they have of the <hi>Oyle of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Get the life of faith:</hi> get faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased and strengthened, and exercise it constantly and vigorously. For hereby
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180407:103"/> you will abide in Christ (yea, and he who is your life will abide in you; he will dwell in your hearts by faith in whom all fullness dwells) and that's the way to be in a flourishing as well as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note>
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. For from him you may be furnished with all supplyes requisite to maintain it:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> as, <hi>with wisdom</hi> both for the well understanding of the mysterie of salvation, and the truths you are to profess, and for the well managing of your practice: <hi>with righteousness</hi> to justifie you in the sight of God, and instate you in his favour: <hi>with sanctification</hi> to purifie you, and make your conversation holy and without blemish in the sight of men;<note place="margin">Isa. 45.24.</note>

Thus may all your needs be supplyed from him <hi>who filleth all in all,</hi> or, <hi>with all</hi> things requisite, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.23. if you live in the constant exercise of faith, whereby as you have a right to the benefits of Christ, so you shall have them conveyed into you, by which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:180407:103"/> means your souls will be in a thriving state, and your conversations more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and comfortable. Jer. 17.7, 8. <hi>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. For he shall be as a Tree planted by the waters, and that spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out her roots by the River, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green, and shall not be carefull in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</hi> Which words though relating to that temporal prosperity which those that trusted in God and not in an arm of flesh for safety should enjoy, yet are as truly applicable to that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual prosperity that attends the life of faith, that flourishing condition which is consequent upon believing in Christ, and stedfast relying on his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Faith preserves from decaying, <hi>through it you are kept unto salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. The more strongly you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the more boldly and constantly will you profess, and the more exact and chearful will your demeanour be; the faster will you hold both truth, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and comfort. Hence you read of the <hi>Joy of faith, Phil.</hi> 1.25. and of those who <hi>believing rejoiced with joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:180407:104"/> and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Get warmth of Love</hi> to the truths and wayes of God, zeal for his glory, fervency in his service: The greater heat of holy affections there is in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, the fresher and fairer he appears to discerning eyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Get the light of Gods favour,</hi> the shine of his face, the refreshings of his presence, the irradiations or manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his love. This will make your colour more lightsome, your <hi>green</hi> more <hi>bright and lively.</hi> Follow God with <hi>Davids</hi> request, Psal. 4.6. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> And urge Christs promise in Joh. 14.21, 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him (and I will love him, and manifest my self to him,</hi> v. 21.) <hi>and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi> Look to your love and obedience, and then look up to God and you shall be illightned. To maintain close communion with him and to beware of whatever may interrupt it, is the way to be under his cheering beams.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S an Introduction hereunto, let me premise, that many things are mistaken for grace, because they look like it, or towards it; or have some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, appearance, or colour of grace upon them; and are several alterations and Emendations in men, which fall short of Renovation, and are not true grace.</p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:180407:108"/>
                  <p>I will instance in five Particulars: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural Parts;</hi> an acute Wit, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Invention, retentive Memory, free Speech, and sweet Disposition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Moral Vertues;</hi> Justice, Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance, Sobriety, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Civility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are a step higher than natural parts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Common Gifts</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Common Works</hi> of the Spirit upon the soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Outward Performances of Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three last I shall describe more largely than the two first, shewing what they are.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Common Gifts of the Spirit</hi> are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The knowledge of God</hi> and Christ, of the Law and Gospel, of a System of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; Some attain to a great measure hereof, as the Hypocritical Jews, Rom. 2.17, 18. <hi>Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the Law, and makest thy boast of God, and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed out of the Law;</hi> and many other Hypocrites and Apostates, as <hi>Judas</hi> and others, Titus 1.16. <hi>They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:180407:108"/>
                  <p>Such may have <hi>Illumination;</hi> some Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-light in the things of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. as the foolish Virgins had Lamps and Light, but no oyl of grace; and so have many that fall away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Gifts of Expounding Scripture,</hi> called prophesying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. and other Church-gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. <hi>to</hi> 12. enabling to teach others, as that Hypocritical Jew did, Rom. 2.19, 20. <hi>And art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that thou thy self art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, an instructer of the foolish, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Gifts of Discourse,</hi> Dispute, Utterance and Elocution. A man may be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of expressing their Brain-light, and are able to resolve doubts, answer cases, to comfort, edifie, instruct others (<hi>Judas</hi> had this) and to perform those by way of Gift, from the Light and ability the Holy Ghost giveth them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Gifts of Prayer;</hi> Hypocrites may and do excell therein.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Gifts of Arts and Sciences, given,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For making curious works, as unto <hi>Bezalut</hi> for the Tabernacles, <hi>Exodus</hi> 31.3.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:180407:109"/>
                  <p>For Government, as Prudence and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, as to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.6. <hi>And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God came upon</hi> Saul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>For Wars, as Strength, Fortitude, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Martial skill. He teacheth mens hands to war, and fingers to fight.</p>
                  <p>Heroick Gifts for valiant atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fit for a King and a Captain.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 49, 50. who overcame the Lion, the Bear, and <hi>Goliah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>Sampson,</hi> Judg. 14.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghost is the Author of all Excellency in common gifts of Nature and Reason.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Common Works of the Spirit</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soul, though they be the effects of an outward Call, and some beginnings of Spiritual Good, and have a Tendency in them thereto; yet they fall short of Grace and Renovation. They oft lye and dye and come to nothing. They go out as sparks of fire, and dry up as drops of water, without any real effect, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Change produced thereby. They leave no more Impress of holiness, or newness upon the heart, than the Eagle doth of her flight in the air; or the Ship
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:180407:109"/> of its way in the Sea, or the Serpent of his Tract upon a Rock.</p>
                  <p>The Spirits common works are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Conviction of Sin,</hi> Legal Humiliation, horror of Conscience, Spirit of bondage, fear of Gods Judgements.</p>
                  <p>These may be without Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or a dram of Grace.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Felix's</hi> trembling at the word, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judas's</hi> repenting, restoring and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, when he saw that Jesus was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Esau's</hi> bewayling the loss of his birth-right with Tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16.17.</p>

                     <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> confessing his sin, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27, 28.) to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Saul</hi> his sin to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24, 30. and his weeping to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 24.16.</p>

                     <hi>Ahab's</hi> fasting, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27, 29. hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Perswasions to Good,</hi> to embrace the Gospel, and Christianity; to come to Christ, and to follow him for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as many of his Disciples did, who afterwards went back and walked no more with him, <hi>John</hi> 6.66. King <hi>Agrippa</hi> was perswaded almost by <hi>Paul,</hi> to become a Christian, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.28.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:180407:110"/>3. <hi>Good Motions</hi> wrought in the will or some religious affections in duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When upon the understanding of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings or Promises, the will is touched with some affections to those things they speak of, as those which are naturally hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or beneficial to it. Hypocrites may affect holy duties as suitable to their ends and hopes, though not as to their frame and disposition. They may have,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Joy in hearing</hi> the Word preached, as the Stony Ground that had not root, and fell away in Time of persecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20.</p>
                  <p>And in the Ministry of godly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; as <hi>Ezekiels hearers</hi> did in his, he was like a pleasant and well tuned Instrument to them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.31. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, and reverenced his person even for his piety, because he was a good man, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Johns Hearers</hi> rejoyced for a season in his light and Ministry, yet after fell away, <hi>John</hi> 5.35.</p>
                  <p>This is to taste the good word of God, and relish some sweetness in it, which those may attain unto that fall away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. How much are many affected at a Sermon, that are not effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted thereby.</p>

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:180407:113"/>I. The Excellency of Grace appears in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, and in the Manner how it is wrought.</p>
                  <p>Grace is the supernatural Image of God, 1. In which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, and we in him (as being in his Loins) but he lost it, both for himself and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, by his Transgression, he being the Common Parent of us all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To which we are renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, righteousness and true holiness, by regeneration, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By which we are made new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. and partakers of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Hereby Christ is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us, and we are made Conformable to him.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Reason</hi> makes a <hi>Man,</hi> so <hi>Grace</hi> makes a <hi>Christian;</hi> and gives him his specifical Being as he is a Christian; as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the Grace of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>I am, that I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace is the Renovation of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which God worketh in us, not by Extraction, or drawing good qualities out of the soul, as if they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there before, as if Seeds of Grace as well as of Sin were in us by Nature; but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:180407:114"/> by Infusion of a new Principle into the soul, which illightens the mind, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the inward frame or disposition of the Heart or Will, and reforms the life. This Principle of Grace is infused into the soul by the effectual operation of the Spirit of God, and the Word (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) at the Conversion or Regeneration of a sinner, <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>James</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p>Man is the subject thereof, capable as he is rational; but resisting to it, as by reason of inherent corruption; and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive in the first act of Conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is dead in trespasses and sins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. and hath no spiritual life or strength; and acts no further therein, than he is acted. <hi>It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. — <hi>primum velle &amp; primum operari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turn thou me,</hi> saith <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>and I shall be turned.</hi> None are able to turn themselves, to repent and return to God, without Gods grace, power and help, not from backsliding after Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, much less from their Apostacy in <hi>Adam,</hi> at their first Conversion to God.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>When Tenders of Grace and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life are made to all, why do some receive, and others refuse the same?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:180407:114"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Gods Elect embrace offers of grace and Christ, and turn to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will do it; and are renewed, because they are willing to be renewed. This Act of their will is not by Nature, but as they are acted and biassed by Gods Spirit and grace, which doth not force the Act or Consent of the will, but alters the inward disposition or inclination of it effectually.</p>
                  <p>The wicked are not converted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, because they will not turn to God, they will not be renewed: they reject the Tender of Grace, and resist the Spirit of Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>This Refusal is the proper Act of their will, proceeding from inherent pravity, or the Natural Disposition of it to sin.</p>
                  <p>Herein grace excells Moral Vertues and Common Gifts; <hi>scil.</hi> In the Nature of it, and the Manner how it is wrought; for these are but the Natural Image of God in men; of a lower and more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary stamp or kind, than the supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Image of God, or the Divine Nature, is.</p>
                  <p>These are acquired (ordinarily) by Education, Exercise, Industry, Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Example.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:180407:115"/>
                  <p>They are indeed Excellencies and great Improvements of Nature: but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after the greatest Improvements of it, is but Nature still, until it be supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally renewed; &amp; can make a man no more than a natural man, as opposed to a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man or regenerate: and <hi>the Natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
                  <p>These cannot bow, encline, or raise the will to receive the offers of Christ, Grace and Spirit, when made to it in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Excellency of Grace appears in or by the <hi>Root, or Fountain,</hi> from whence Saving Grace doth originally grow, or flow into the soul, which is double, <hi>scil.</hi>

                        <item>Through Faith.</item>
                     </list> Whereby a soul being engrafted into Christ as its Vine, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into him, as its Head, and married to him as its Husband, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.23, 24. and joyned to him as its fountain, receives grace from Ghrist, as the Branch doth sap from the Root: as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do Sense and Motion from the Heads: as the Wife doth nourishing and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.29. and a Joynture from her Husband; as Pipes and Channels do water from a Fountain.</p>
                  <p>For in Christ all fatness of grace is laid up, even for us. Col. 1.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2, 3. <hi>And
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:180407:116"/> of his fulness we receive grace for grace,</hi> John 1.16. that is, the beginning, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and perfection of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Reception of grace is communion with Christ in his holiness, or the stamp and Impress of Christ upon the soul; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Christ is made unto us of God, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and Union with Christ is the ground of this communion; therefore it is said—<hi>of him are ye in Christ Jesus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> usual Close of his Epistles, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 16.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.18. and in divers others, shews Christ to be the Author and Donor of all grace; the Spring from whence, and the Conduit by whom all grace is derived and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto all believers; by the Fathers good pleasure and designment.</p>
                  <p>But Common Gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God bestows upon men out of his common goodness, and sometimes for the benefit of others, rather than of themselves. Hence they are given to all, therefore they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the Elect from the Reprobates. No man knows special love or hatred by these.</p>
                  <p>These flow from a lower spring than
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:180407:116"/> Union with Christ; and do not either presuppose, or inferr it necessarily. A man may have them in a great measure, and yet be out of Christ, (or without Christ) a stranger, yea, an enemy to Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Excellency of Grace appears in the <hi>Effects or fruits</hi> thereof, which are those that follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace <hi>illightneth and quickneth</hi> the soul from the darkness and death of sin to the light and life of righteousness, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.8, 14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10.</p>
                  <p>Grace is a beam of Divine Light sent down from God the Father of Light; and from Christ the Sun of Righteousness (<hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2.) into the soul: which lights the Candle of our Spirits (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27.) that was put out by the Fall: and sets up such a light within us, which the shadow of death cannot damp or darken. Grace makes us children of light and of the day, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.5. It is the Ray of the Day-Star (Christ) arising in our hearts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Grace is Sun-shine in the soul. Grace dispelleth the shadows and darkness of Sin, ignorance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace is a Seed or Principle of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:180407:117"/> life in the soul, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. it is, as it were, the soul of the soul, which doth give the <hi>Esse, vivere &amp; operari</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity to it.</p>
                  <p>Grace is the fruits of Christs resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12, 13, and the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof, into which we are planted by an Emanation of a vivifical vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. Hence we are said to be begotten again by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Jesus Christ from the dead unto a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>Grace is the water of life, which Christ the fountain of living water gives in to our souls, <hi>John</hi> 4.10, 14.</p>
                  <p>It is a vital Ligament, which tyes us as Members to Christ as our head. None can say with <hi>Paul</hi> in Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live,</hi> or <hi>Christ liveth in me,</hi> but <hi>by the grace of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Common Gifts and Moral Vertues adorn a man, as Flowers do a dead body that is stuck with them, which make it to smell well, but not to live at all. So these may sweeten a natural man, but cannot quicken him; they may elevate or raise him to Civil and Moral actions; or to spiritual performances in the matter of them, as to preach, pray, discourse
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180407:117"/> of the things of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But these leave the soul in <hi>Hades,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of spiritual death, or dead in trespasses and sins, and a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the life of God; dead to all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons spiritual as to manner and end; and in much spiritual darkness.</p>
                  <p>Men may flourish in gifts and parts, and yet be dead while they live: and have not a seed or spark of spiritual life in them. These are but like Candles light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or though they appear as Stars, yet all the shine of them, cannot make a man a child of light, or a child of the day; but leave him to be a child of the night and of darkness, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                  <p>Counterfeit graces, as simulated San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, feigned Humility, pretended zeal, mercenary Love, presumptuous Hope, vain-glorious Charity, self-ended Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameableness, partial Obedience, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less performance of duties.</p>
                  <p>These may give a Hypocrite the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but not the life; the paint, but not the right complexion, much less the pulse of a true Christian, a vizzard of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and carkass of devotion, without heat or life of spiritual affection.</p>
                  <p>These may make up a lifeless picture of a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180407:118"/> Professor, who hath the form without the power of godliness, the shew without the substance. For <hi>esse videatur,</hi> is the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Hypocrite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Effect, Grace <hi>resists, and by degrees mortifieth sin in us: all</hi> sin, one as well as another: Sin in <hi>heart</hi> as in <hi>life;</hi> in the <hi>root</hi> as well as in the <hi>branch</hi> or <hi>bud;</hi> lust in the conception, as sin in the birth, or production of it; in the first motions of it within, and in all Tentations to it and Occasions of it from without; in the appearance or shew, as in the Entity or Substance of it, such as it hath. And all this out of pure and perfect hatred of sin, as it is sin, and most opposite to the will and Law, Holiness and Glory of God; and to the regenerate part in us.</p>
                  <p>For Grace and Sin are Contraries. Hence comes the Combate between the Flesh and the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. between the Law in the Members, and of the mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. There may be a Lust or strife between the Dictates of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and corruption, without true grace, upon Gods Command prohibiting sin, or Gods Judgments punishing it: But this Conflict between Sin and Grace, Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Corruption of Nature is in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:180407:118"/> the same faculty; or in the will renewed against corrupt inclinations cohabiting, but not reigning and predominant: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween humility and pride, patience and passion, contentation and covetousness, chastity and uncleanness, sincerity and hypocrisie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Duel fought hand to hand.</p>
                  <p>This skirmish with sin is proper to Grace as the chief Antagonist of it in the soul, which is at deadly feud and variance with it.</p>
                  <p>Grace as truly and really resists sin as light expects darkness, as fire fights against water, or heat against cold; or as a man strikes, stabs or kills his enemy.</p>
                  <p>Grace not only cuts off the bough of of sin in the life, but layes the Axe of Mortification to the Root of Corruption in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Grace makes it a souls daily exercise, to live in war with sin, and at peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts and moral Vertues may discover and restrain corruption, or keep it in, that it break not out into the life; but they cannot kill or mortifie Sin in men. They may <hi>lop</hi> off the Branches of Sin in the Life; but not <hi>eradicate</hi> it, or
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:180407:119"/> pluck it up by the Root in the heart; <hi>dam</hi> sin in, but not <hi>drie</hi> it up, nor drive it out; <hi>chain</hi> up the wolf, but cannot <hi>kill</hi> it: they may <hi>skin</hi> over the Sores of Corruption, but not <hi>heal</hi> them to the bottom, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the causes of them.</p>
                  <p>Sin may break out again, for all the Grace of Restraint or common Gifts which men have: and be as a Wolf, when got loose: or like a Sow (that hath been shut up in a fair Medow of Morality and Civility) which returns to her wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Mire.</p>
                  <p>It is above the sphear of the Activity of Common Gifts, to set the Heart in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation against all and every Sin and as it is Sin. But they suffer men to retain and harbour in their bosomes, a secret love or liking of some sins especially, which are most suitable to their Natures. Yet they dare not live, nor allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the open practice of them for fear of shame, disgrace or punishment: As one may be afraid to take up a coal, not so much because it blacks, but burns, and is too hot to hold: so are many of sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. Effect, Grace <hi>Sanctifieth</hi> us throughout, or wholly in every part, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.23. according to the Measure
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:180407:119"/> of it received; though not perfectly here in respect of degrees.</p>
                  <p>Grace transforms or metamorphoseth a sinner into a Saint, It makes us truly, really and spiritually holy; both inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly; it worketh a change in the <hi>heart,</hi> and a reformation in the <hi>life.</hi> It is a new-moulding of us into our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Image, and Saviours likeness (as I shewed before) It causeth old things in us (our old frame or bias of spirit, and our old course of life) to pass away; and all things to become new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. to wit, our disposition of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Grace makes both the Tree good (our hearts) and the fruit good, our lives, Matth. 7.14, 18. Hence <hi>the Tree is known by his fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace sanctifies both our <hi>Persons,</hi> and our <hi>Gifts:</hi> them to us, and us to our works; to make us more useful and serviceable by them.</p>
                  <p>Grace makes us as carefull to cleanse our hearts as our hands, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. and our selves from all pollutions of spirit as well as of flesh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Grace causeth the Eye to water at the very Motes of Sin, to weep them out of the soul.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:180407:120"/>
                  <p>Common Gifts and moral Vertues may make a man to be outwardly reformed, and unblameable;<note place="margin">Matth. 23.27, 28.</note> to appear righteous before men: and carefull to make clean the outside of the cup and of the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and seemingly Saint-like: but not to be inwardly renewed, refined, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, holy, pure in heart, not gracious in the sight of God, though they may be pure in their own eyes, Prov. 30.12. <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Civil Honesty is a fair Outside that may be consistent with a foul inside; as the Paint of a Sepulchre without, with dead mens bones and rottenness within. Civility grows many times in Natures gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that hath not in it one Herb of grace.</p>
                  <p>An old Heart covered over meerly with Civility, is but like an old Man clad with new Cloaths, which cannot make him young again: or like an old rotten Poste painted or gilt over, that can never make it sound, or heart of Oake.</p>
                  <p>Common abilities may make the <hi>fruits</hi> of mens Actions or performances good in their lives (that is, instrumental
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:180407:120"/> through Gods blessing for the benefit of others) but cannot make the <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>root</hi> of their Affections good in themselves. They may make them <hi>Trees of knowledge</hi> unto others; but not <hi>Trees of Life</hi> in and to themselves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Effect. Grace is very <hi>active, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative</hi> and <hi>efficacious,</hi> it is not in vain where it is: it made <hi>Paul labour more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>If these things</hi> (that is the Grace of the Spirit) <hi>be in you and abound,</hi> saith <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8.</note>
                     <hi>they make you, that ye shall neither be barren <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or unfruitfull</hi> (but actuous and fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) <hi>in the knowledge of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that <hi>faith</hi> (that Radical Grace) is said to be <hi>Living, Rom.</hi> 1.17. The just liveth by faith; and <hi>working,</hi> therefore we read of the works of faith, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>walking:</hi> we walk by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Love</hi> is said to be <hi>Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.

                  <p>What God doth for us, or makes us to do, is by his Grace in us. Grace in the heart, is like the heart in the body, a fountain of Motion to the whole Man:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:180407:121"/> like the Spirit in the Wheels in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> vision:<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> Like the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> among the Sphears; or the Spring in the Watch that sets all the Wheels on going. Grace is a holy inclination to suitable Action. It is to the Soul as a bias to the bowle, or bent to the bow. It causeth prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and rectitude; or makes us ready to every good work, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. Grace Files and Oiles all the Wheels (or faculties) of the Soul, to move smoothly, and swiftly.</p>
                  <p>Grace makes us abundant in the Works of the Lord,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. and fruitfull in all well-doing, and full of good works, as <hi>Dorcas</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.36.</p>
                  <p>And to have respect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements as <hi>David</hi> had to the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the Duties of it first and most,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.6.</note> and to the second Table and the Duties of it next, but for the first, and as flowing from the first.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts though they make men more able every way to do Service, yet they suffer them many times to be idle: to lap up their Talents in Napkins, to smother them: as some men of great and excellent parts do; who are like Graves to their Gifts, to bury them in; and like
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:180407:121"/> Drones in their Hives, or places where they live, they do little or no good.</p>
                  <p>Moral Vertues make men respect the second Table, and duties of it only, or chiefly, and neglect the first Table: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gifts suffer men to be partial in Gods Law, what to do, or leave undone, as they please.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. Effect, Grace not only excites us to activity and diligence, But <hi>guides us to act</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Mark. 7.37.</note> Grace disposeth the soul to carry continually, and to do all its duties and works as before the Lord, as in his sight and presence; so as to please God, and be accepted with him, and to approve it self to God in all things; to make him a witness of all his wayes. So did <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20, 21. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.4. see <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.</p>
                  <p>Moral vertues as they act but in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane strength and are conversant about outward things, so they aim but at humane
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180407:122"/> ends; they can rise no higher, for their Principles can reach no further.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts suffer men to act from poor <hi>low Principles,</hi> and for such like <hi>Ends,</hi> that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From self;</hi> in their own strength only, or in the strength of parts or gifts received.</p>

                  <p>Hence, Many that are full, richly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with Common Gifts, are but Empty Vines, bringing forth fruit to themselves, <hi>Hosea</hi> 10.1.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Confidently</hi> in God for his presence and power in them, a holy use and happy issue out of them, without despondency, fainting, or sinking, 2 Cor. 4.16, 17. <hi>Therefore we faint not,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> because we believe.</p>

                  <p>Grace makes both men and women couragious, undaunted, insuperable in their sufferings for a good God, a good Cause, and a good Conscience: as it did <hi>Moses,</hi> to refuse to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter; to forsake <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not to fear the wrath of the King:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24, 27.

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Sincerely:</hi> Grace causeth us to chuse affliction rather than sin; as it did <hi>Joseph</hi> to leave his Garment in his Mistress's hand, and to lose his liberty and be put in Prison, before he would lye with his Mistris, or do that great wickedness, and sin against God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> to chuse rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. and the <hi>three Children</hi> to choose rather to be cast into <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> burning fiery Fornace,<note place="margin">Dan 3.18.</note> than worship his Golden Image: and <hi>Daniel</hi> to be cast into the Den of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> rather than not to pray and give

                  <p n="7">7th Effect, <hi>Grace strengthens</hi> the soul, to the forementioned effects; as to be full of livelyhood in performance of duties; to bear afflictions, and bow the neck to Christs yoak, and the back to his Cross, and to our Fathers Rod submissively; to resist Corruptions and Tentations readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and strenuously; to overcome the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the World vigorously; to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in well-doing and in well-suffering constantly, even to the end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace is a sinew of divine strength in the soul (Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> to be strong in (or by) the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.) as <hi>Wisdom.</hi> A wise man is strong saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 24.5.

                  <p>A gracious soul is like a man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Armour <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> that encreaseth strength, as he doth grace.</p>
                  <p>But the Excellency of Grace is, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:180407:126"/> though it be strong in it self, yet it acts (or excites us to act) not in its own strength only, but in the strength of Christ through the spirit, as I hinted before.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts are weak feeble things (being compared with Grace) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:180407:127"/> of the world, to live at a higher (more spiritual) Rate; to move in a higher Sphear, and act after a more sublime mode, than they do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Above the good things</hi> of the world, as riches, honours, pleasures, and all worldly pomp, glory, excellency, above creature-comfort and delight: Grace car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes a soul above all the sublimities of it, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark did him above the tops of the Mountains; and lifts up a soul to look at all sublunary things as below it, and unworthy of it, as things put under a Christians feet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. to despise and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on them all, in Comparison of Christ and of things above; to see vanity, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity; emptiness and unsatisfactoriness in them. It is the design of Grace to put a soul into the same posture with the Woman in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. <hi>scil.</hi> to be cloathed with the Sun, and have the Moon under her feet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

The Grace of Christ is sufficient for us, to make us conquerours, and to triumph over them
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:180407:127"/> all. Grace raiseth up our spirits above them so as not to fear them; nor to faint or despond under them, nor to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Heaven-ward by them; but to overcome them (or get above them) by patient bearing of them or standing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Affliction improved by Grace, helps to lift up a soul nearer Heaven as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the flood bare up <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, above the Earth. Hence some <hi>Saints</hi> have had the most raised sublimated spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in their lowest estates, as the Apostles and the holy Martyrs and others.</p>
                  <p>It is the Nature of Grace to work the soul upward in all its motions, towards God; and they are lift up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Grace is a holy fire sent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to be kept continually burning in our hearts; the sparks whereof flye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as sparks of fire do) and our souls ascend in them to Heaven, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did in a fiery Chariot, and as the Angel in the flame of the Altar. It makes us when we go to sleep,<note place="margin">Judg. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and when we awake to be still with God, as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.18.</p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:180407:128"/>
                  <p>Every thing moves towards its proper place; whence it came, thither it would return as Rivers do from and to the Sea, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.7. Grace comes from Heaven, therefore it strives to go to Heaven, and to carry our souls thither. It makes us count our selves and carry as strangers and Pilgrims here below, as in a strange Countrey; as far from home as Heaven is from Earth: and to go homeward, that is, Heaven-ward, upward, to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, as our long, last, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Journey towards felicity and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Grace gives a soul Wings like a Dove to fly up to Christ the Rock of Ages,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.14.</note> and hide it self in the cleft of it, to be safe and secure: yea makes it mount up with Wings as Eagles. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.31. to soare aloft. Grace is a pully to wind up the soul to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts are but low Principles (in comparison of Grace) for men to live, walk, work or act by; they cannot Wing them for God, Heaven, or things above, but suffer them to be like creeping things, or go by grounds; to mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and set their affections on things below, and seek great things for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:180407:128"/> themselves here: to make earth their Throne and Heaven their footstole, and have their portion in this life.</p>
                  <p>They leave men to be of the World as well as in it; to conform and fashion themselves to it; to comply with and be acted by the spirit of the World; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World loves them, and speaks well of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. Hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifted men for the most part finde more favour in and from the World, than spiritual-graced men do.</p>
                  <p>It is not in the power of Common Gifts and parts, to sublimate or raise up mens spirits to a high, spiritual, heavenly pitch or frame, to live much above the Rate, Sphear, or Element of the World, and the men of it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9th Effect, <hi>Grace Saveth us,</hi> and that with an everlasting Salvation, Eph. 2.8. <hi>by grace ye are saved,</hi> which includes not only Free-Grace, good will and pleasure in God, but also sanctifying grace from God. He calls the grace of the spirit, those better things, which accompany Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Grace accompanies Salvation five wayes.</p>

                  <p>As, <hi>faith</hi> in God, 1 Pet. 1.9. Joh. 3.16, 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. By way <hi>Of preparation;</hi> every Grace conduceth to fit us for Heaven, and the Kingdom of Glory. We cannot want one Grace, if we would perfect holiness in the fear of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Of evidence</hi> and assurance. Every Grace is a sign of Salvation. Grace is one of the three that bear witness on Earth, 1 Joh. 5.8. —<hi>the spirit,</hi> and <hi>the water</hi> (that is, sanctifying Grace) and <hi>the blood</hi>— and this is the Record that God hath given us Eternal life, <hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>The Graces of the Spirit are the first fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us in this life, for an earnest or pledge to assure us of the whole lump or crop of Glory, which we shall receive in the life to come. The least sparke or mite of Grace may be a sure sign of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Matth. 12.23. <hi>A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoaking flax shall he not quench till he send forth
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:180407:130"/> judgement unto victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. By way <hi>Of initiation;</hi> for grace is glory begun, and glory is grace perfected. Grace is the forerunner of glory, and glory is the consummator of grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. hereby an entrance is ministred abundantly unto us into the everlasting Kingdom of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Common gifts are neither sure Causes, nor certain evidences of Salvation. Though they be excellent in themselves, yet they will suffer men to fall short of Heaven, and to perish and sink into hell, as they did <hi>Cain, Saul, Judas,</hi> Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, Hypocrites, Apostates, false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, false Apostles, false Brethren.</p>
                  <p>These serve for the good of others (as I have shewed) many times more than of those that have and use them; to qualifie men for imployments, as for the service of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. &amp;c. whereby they may profit others, and civilize themselves, but not sanctifie or save themselves; being like the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters that built an Ark for <hi>Noah,</hi> and perished themselves: Some that teach others may be cast-awayes themselves; and that <hi>sit</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>chair</hi> may never <hi>lye</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>bosome.</hi> Vertue and civility
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:180407:130"/> are bestowed on the Heathens (saith one) for a common good,<note place="margin">Pemble.</note> for preservation of humane Society, to serve Gods Providence therein; they being the bonds and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news thereof, without which men could not live nor converse peaceably.</p>
                  <p>But these could not intitle nor advance them to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts and moral Vertues are attainable under a Covenant of works, under which is no salvation. Yea, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Parts, and Eminent abilities in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, are no sure signs of Grace (because they and Grace are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) much less of Glory.</p>
                  <p>Yea even extraordinary Gifts, as of Prophecy, working Miracles, ejecting Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been given to some, whom Christ will disown, disclaim and call workers of iniquity, and shut out of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts may obtain temporal rewards, but not Eternal. And Authors observe, that God hath prospered those persons and Common-Wealths much, wherein Honesty and Morality were best maintained, as that of the Romans long.<note place="margin">

                  <p>A gracious soul cannot frame or make up to himself a heart content or soul-satisfaction, of all creature-comforts put together; but pitcheth upon spiritual, suitable refreshments and comforts of a higher and heavenlier stamp and strain.</p>

                  <p>Common Gifts cannot satisfie a soul, nor give sound, solid, peace, joy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to it, but they leave the heart em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty of these, even when the Head is filled with Parts and Gifts.</p>
                  <p n="11">11th Effect, <hi>Grace makes us humble</hi> in Spirit; little and low, yea, vile in our own eyes, to be as Valleyes, Shrubs; as it did <hi>Abraham,</hi> to think himself but dust and ashes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. and <hi>Jacob</hi> to be less than the least of all Gods mercies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.10. and <hi>Job</hi> to be vile with an <hi>Ecce, Chap.</hi> 40.4. Behold I am vile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>John Baptist</hi> to think himself not worthy to unloose the latchet of Christs Shoos, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Peter</hi> to confess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, a man, a sinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.8. a mixture, as it were, of sin and filth: and the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> to say, he was not worthy that Christ should enter under his roof, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.6. and <hi>Paul</hi> to think himself the least of Saints and greatest of sinners, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. and to be nothing, though he was in nothing behind the very chiefest Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:180407:132"/>
                  <p>Now Grace produceth this effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace is light, which discovers sin and self, and the foolishness of both in us; our emptiness of grace, vileness and unworthiness; and the beauty, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and glory of God, and the dreadful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between God and us; which makes us loath, and abhor our selves as <hi>Job</hi> did, and repent in dust and ashes.<note place="margin">Job 42.5, 6 Ezek. 6 9.</note> Much mixture of corruption is in the highest and most enlarged exercise of grace; which grace discovers, as it doth also the iniquities of our holy things; and how our best actions are stained with imperfections and defects, and all this to humble us. Hence Christians are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to offend by, or to fall into the sin that is most contrary to that grace wherein they most excell, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in distrust; <hi>Moses</hi> in passion, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.14, 19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.33. <hi>Job</hi> in impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Divers actions of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recorded in Scripture, are blemisht with notable failings, as was that of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Heb.</hi> 11.31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grace lets us see, that what we are,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.</note> have, or do that is good, is all from God, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.) not at all from our selves;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:180407:133"/> Hence it inclines and engageth our hearts to ascribe all the glory hereof to God alone,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.14.</note> and to take no praise at all to our selves. So did <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the grace of God, I am, what I am, &amp;c.—I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> Those good servants in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.16.18. acknowledged, that not they, but their Masters Talents had gained so much more. Not our pains, but thy pounds.</p>
                  <p>Hence those that have the most grace, are the humblest souls.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts without special Grace puff men up, and make them proud, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> affected gifts more than Grace (for which <hi>Paul</hi> reproves them) because by their gifts they were more admired and applauded. The Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. speaks of diverse Carnal effects of spiritual abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as to lift men up in self-conceit: to make rents and parties in Christs Church, to bring things into confusion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
                  <p n="12">12th Effect, <hi>Grace is diffusive and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative</hi> of it self to others, as the Sun is of light, the Fire of heat, the Water of moisture, the Earth of its
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:180407:133"/> fruits, the Fountain of water, the flower of its sweetness.</p>
                  <p>Grace is coelestial liquor infused into our souls, not to be barrel'd and bunged up for our own use only, but to be broached and drawn forth for the benefit of others: or a Treasure to be laid in, to the end it may be laid out: and a Talent given to us with a charge to be employed and improved, not only for our Heavenly Masters advantage, but also for our fellow-servants good, as well as our own. <hi>When thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, i. e.</hi> recovered from thy fall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of thy Master, saith Christ to <hi>Peter, strengthen thy brethren, Luke</hi> 22.32.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.10</note> So he doth excellently in both his Epistles.</p>
                  <p>To this effect I may add two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Grace gives a Christian expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in himself of the things of God; and enables him to speak thereof from his own heart (which goeth most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to the hearts of others) and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what God hath done for his soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.16.</p>
                  <p>Grace will make a man, a Minister espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to eat the roul (of Gods revealed will or word) and digest it before he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:180407:134"/> declare it, and chew the meat of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Doctrine or Counsel first, and suck sweetness and nutriment into his soul, and labour to feel the efficacy of it in his own heart, which he gives forth unto others, (as the Nurse chews meat for the Child) to commend it from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, Ezek. 2.8. &amp; 3.1, 2, 7. <hi>Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll and go speak to the House of</hi> Israel. So <hi>John</hi> is commanded to eat the little Book, and then told he must prophesie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9, 11.</p>
                  <p>Grace helps Christians to eat the truths of God by faith, and digest them by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and therewith to feed others; and excites them to a further reception and concoction of spiritual things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it is that Grace is not only Communicative to others, but thereby augmentative, accumulative and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to it self, by scattering (in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) it gathereth: by lighting the Candles of others, it shines more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by kindling or blowing up the coals of good affections in others, it enflames it self and burns hotter: by watering others, it is watered also it self, to wit, with Gods blessing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. to make the soul, that is liberal in the exercise
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:180407:134"/> of it, fatter and fuller, and more fruitful in every good work. <hi>To him that hath (i. e.</hi> that useth what he hath, even for the good of others) <hi>shall be given, and he shall have abundance, Matth.</hi> 25.29.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts suffer men many times to be reserved and retentive thereof to themselves alone, to monopolize them, and think much to communicate them unto others, lest their excellency should be Eclipsed thereby; or enables them to speak from the head, not from the heart, from Notion, not from affections, from Speculation, not from practice. They leave men to be strangers in Experience, to what they hold forth in Expressions. Like dry Nurses, that have no Milk of their own, but what they prepare for their children. Like Cooks that dress dainties for others, but eat none of them. Like Messengers that carry Tokens or Presents to others, but do not partake thereof.</p>

Over the <hi>good things</hi> in it, as riches, honours, pleasures, friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or sitting loose in our affections from them, to be willing to part with them when God (or men by his Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) deprives us of them, or of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them. Grace made <hi>Davids</hi> soul to be, and carry as a weaned Child, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Over the <hi>evil things</hi> in it, as Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Distress, Persecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All kind of Afflictions, by faith and patience in them all, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10.</p>
                  <p>By faith in Christ, and patience or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Christ, we are more than Conquerours over them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. that is, we overcome and are sure of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory before we fight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Grace gets and gives us victory <hi>over the Devil,</hi> his Wiles, Tentations and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:180407:138"/> and enables us so to resist him as to make him flee from us, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. and to keep our selves, that the wicked one touch us not, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18. that is, cannot get within us, nor get advantage against us. This is the purport of our putting on the whole armour of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.11.</p>
                  <p>This Victory which the Grace of God obtains for us, <hi>scil.</hi> over Sin, Self, World and Satan, hath a great Influence into our overcoming of others Evil with our Good, which <hi>Conquest</hi> of evil with good by Grace hath four properties: It is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Godly or <hi>Godlike</hi> Victory, or to overcome, as God the Father doth the Sons of men, our evil with his good; to this end he makes his Sun to rise, and rain to fall, on the just and unjust. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. and to imitate him herein, is to be (that is, to declare our selves to be) the children of our Father which is in Heaven: and to be perfect, as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. which is a most excellent degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Hence this is the design of his goodness, forbearance and long-suffering towards us, to lead us to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:180407:138"/>2. A <hi>Christ-like Victory.</hi> This was Christs way of overcoming all, all Enemies, and all evils all his dayes: and in this way of victorious suffering he finished his work the Father gave him to do, and was made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and entered into his Glory: and herein he hath left us an example of Conquest, that we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his steps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>Gospel-like</hi> Victory, by the Rule, and in the Spirit and Power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. To overcome evil with good through Grace, is a Gospel-becoming Conversation, a great Honour and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it. What glorious Conquests did the Martyrs get over their Enemies, and what advantage to the Truth and Cause of God, by their patient sufferings, and thereby couragious overcomings of Evils from men?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is a <hi>fruit-bearing</hi> Victory.</p>
                  <p>This will produce much Tranquility, Calmness and Comfort in our Spirits (for the exercise of Grace is ever attended with peace) and prevent the contrary, that is, much disquiet and trouble of mind and heart in us, by passion, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and revenge; which, if we be overcome with evil, will raise Tumults
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:180407:139"/> and Commotions in us, and bring our souls into a hurry.</p>
                  <p>This will set off our good with greater lustre; and make it appear to be very goodly and eyely: pure good, even good done for goodness sake: without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to it from men, or self-ends; against provocations and male-deserts to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>This will prevent our good (the good we have done, or do to others) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.16. which is caused not only by our abuse of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty, but by avenging our selves, or by recompensing evil for evil to others in any kind.</p>
                  <p>This will make iniquity (<hi>i. e.</hi> the workers of iniquity) to stop their mouths <hi>Job</hi> 5.16. as afraid and ashamed, to speak evil of our good conversation in Christ. This is the way to put to silence evil-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and evil-doers,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> with our well-doing.</p>
                  <p>This will entitle us to those manifold, pretious Promises entailed by Christ upon him that overcomes, in Rev. 2.7.17.11, 26. &amp; 3.12.21. As, <hi>Eating of the Tree of Life, and of hidden Manna: a white stone; and in it a new name written, which no man knows, saving he that receives it: Being
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:180407:139"/> made a pillar in the Temple of God, and having the name of God, and of the City of God, the</hi> New Jerusalem <hi>written upon him: and the dignity to sit with Christ in his Throne, even as he also overcame, and is set down with his Father in his Throne.</hi> In short, <hi>He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and God will be his God, and he shall be his Son;</hi> as it is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.</p>
                  <p n="14">14th Effect: <hi>Grace grows</hi> in degrees and measure, in height and stature, in strength and vigour, in stability and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
                  <p>I will give you seven Reasons for it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because Grace is <hi>little, low</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> in us <hi>at first,</hi> and must grow up by degrees in the use of Means, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as all Creatures that have life, vegetative, sensitive, or rational Plants, Beasts, Men, do according to their kinds.</p>
                  <p>God gives his people but a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Grace, a Seed, a Kernel, or a Root, a little stock, to begin or set up with.</p>
                  <p>But God hath put a quality into it to grow up more and more: For Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a principle of life, is a principle of growth also.</p>
                  <p>And God hath appointed a measure of stature, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a period of growth for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:180407:140"/> every member to grow up unto, in the Mystical body of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the measure of the stature, or age of the fulness of Christ, wherein Christ filleth all in all.</p>
                  <p>How many Cubits want we here of this our stature, or full measure in Christ; and this we must labour for, and attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by growth.</p>
                  <p>Hence there are several Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians distinguished by their growth, or degrees in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Some are Babes in Christ, and in a great measure carnal, others are (more) spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p>Some are little Children, some young men, some Fathers, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13▪ <hi>Mna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was an old Disciple, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.16.</p>
                  <p>Some are weak, such as have need of Milk; some strong, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13, 14. that have need of strong meats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 12.20</note>Some are smoaking flax, (where there is but little fire, and much smoke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity) or a bruised reed, where there is much breaking, and little strength or healing.</p>
                  <p>Others are like strong Oaks, or flaming Torches.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:180407:140"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. There are <hi>many defects</hi> in the graces of the Saints in this life, in the light or life, heats or power, activity or evidence of them; as in knowledge and in faith; for we know and believe but in part — in love, holiness, humility, sincerity, patience, and in the rest, <hi>Paul</hi> prayed exceedingly, to see the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians face, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 3.10.</note> to perfect the defects or that which was lacking in their faith, <hi>scil.</hi> in knowledge, assent, adherence, assurance.</p>
                  <p>Now the defects of all Graces are to be supplyed, recruited or repaired by Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because Grace is <hi>compared</hi> to such <hi>things</hi> as are <hi>small</hi> in their <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> but <hi>great</hi> in their <hi>growth;</hi> or as must grow, or they cannot be of much use, nor come to maturity or perfection; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the <hi>Morning light,</hi> which begins in a small hairlike ray or Thred of light, but grows till it hath fill'd the whole He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere with glorious beams, Prov. 4.18. the <hi>path of the just is as the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>seed</hi> sown in the Earth, which springs and grows up, first to the blade,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:180407:141"/> then to the eare, and after that to the full corn in the eare, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.28. though insensibly (whilest it is in <hi>fieri</hi>) so as the Seedesman knows not how, or discerns it not in the motion of it; Corn must grow, else it can never be ripe, nor bring forth any increase and there will be no harvest, especially to a <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>Mustard-seed,</hi> which is the least of all seeds when it is sown in the earth, but it grows up and becometh greater than all herbs, <hi>&amp;c. Mark.</hi> 4.31, 32. yea it becometh a Tree, so that the birds of the aire lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
                  <p>Faith is compared to this Grain, for Seed and Growth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To a <hi>sparke</hi> or <hi>smoke,</hi> which grows up or breaks out to be a flame, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To <hi>flowers</hi> as the <hi>Lilly,</hi> Hos. 14.5. <hi>I will be as the dew to</hi> Israel (saith God) <hi>and he shall grow as the Lilly,</hi> to wit, in beauty and glory, which exceeded <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in all his Royalty: in sweetness and fragrancy; (therefore their smell is as <hi>Lebanon, Hos.</hi> 14.6. where many odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Trees and Flowers did grow) in purity and whiteness; <hi>Consider the Lillyes how they grow,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.28.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:180407:141"/>5. To <hi>trees,</hi> which must grow up, or they cannot bear fruit. Hos. 14.6. <hi>they shall cast forth their roots as</hi> Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>and grow as the Vine,</hi> v. 7.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Grace is compared also to <hi>children</hi> that must grow up, or they can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. to a <hi>building</hi> that must be raised or built up higher and higher, else it will never be a house nor fit for use, 1 Cor. 3.9. <hi>Yee are Gods Building.</hi> Building is growing, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.21, 22. to the <hi>members</hi> of the body, which are little at first, and must grow up, or they will never come to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of stature; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. to the <hi>Calves</hi> of the stall, Mal. 4.2. <hi>Yee shall go forth, and grow up as Calves of the Stall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. God gives us <hi>precepts, promises</hi> and <hi>presidents</hi> in his word <hi>for growth</hi> in grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Precepts,</hi> commanding it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and 3.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Promises</hi> ensuring it, that grace shall grow in us, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. <hi>The righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger,</hi> Psal. 92.12. to the 15. <hi>The righteous shall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish like the Palm-tree, he shall grow like a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:180407:142"/> Cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the Courts of our God: they shall still bring forth fruit in old age, they shall be fat and flourishing.</hi> See also <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.11. and <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Presidents</hi> directing it, or examples of the Saints growth in grace, as pattern for our imitation or copies to write after, as of the faith and charity of the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.3, 4. of the knowledge and goodness of the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 15.14. of <hi>Pauls</hi> reaching forth unto those things which were before, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. not resting in his present attainment, but striving after a higher measure or pitch of grace; and pressing towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Christ; <hi>Paul</hi> was a great growing Saint. The Travellers through <hi>Baca</hi> (the valley of Tears) go from strength to strength, till they appear before God in <hi>Zion, Psal.</hi> 84.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 5. We may meet with, 1. Strong Tentations and assaults from the devil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With strong oppositions and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions in and from the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. With strong and violent passions and corruptions in our own hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:180407:142"/>4. With sad desertions and impressions of displeasure from God; and with sad despondencies and dejections in our own spirits, even on this side the Grave, or towards our end. Some of Gods dear children have encountered with greater difficulties a little before their death, than ever they experienced all their lives.</p>
                  <p>This inferrs a necessity of growing in grace, daily to prepare us more and more for all changes, and for the worst of Times and States.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 6. <hi>Growth</hi> in Grace <hi>prevents falling</hi> from Grace, as going forward doth backsliding, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.12, 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. and promotes the souls deeper rooting and stablishing in Christ.<note place="margin">Col. 2.6, 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It produceth in us a growth or increase, (1.) Of obedience and service to God, to bear much fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. and to give him his due honour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of usefulness and good works to men; of serviceableness to our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the will of God; to be greater blessings unto others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of comfort in our selves, which ordinarily is the result of grace for rise and measure. Hence much grace, much
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:180407:143"/> comfort, whereas a little grace in time of great trouble may suffer us to be as sad and comfortless, as if we had no grace at all. As Christ said to his Disciples in the great Tempest in the Sea, when they begun to fear —<hi>O yee of little faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.26. But in <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.40. <hi>how is it that ye have no faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>And Lastly,</hi> Of glory and joy in Heaven. For growth in grace will make our souls vessels of a great quantity, and inlarge the capacity of them to contain much.</p>
                  <p>According to the increase of our grace and obedience active and passive on Earth, shall be the increase of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and glory in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Hence growing in grace is a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for death, judgement and glory; by way of evidence for our assurance; of negotiation for our account and reward; of progress in our journey Heavenward, and the way to be soon there; and in coming up to our full age and stature in Christ, which shall be compleated at death, then our heavenly Inheritance shall come into our hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 7. To this end God gives us <hi>means of grace to grow by,</hi> and <hi>time to grow
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:180407:143"/> in.</hi> His holy Ordinances as food for our souls; as the word to be sincere Milk, that we may grow thereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Indeed Gods Word hath food in it for all sorts and ages of Christians. It hath Milk for babes, and strong Meat for them of full age, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13, 14. and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be feasts of fat things to our souls, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25.6.</p>
                  <p>To this end he plants us in his house, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.13, 14. that is by the Rivers Side. He hath promised to be dew unto us, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.5. to come upon us, as the Rain, as the former and latter Rain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.3. to rain down showers of blessing upon us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.26. God is at much pains and cost with us (as he was with his Vineyard, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.4.) to make us grow in grace day by day; and to make us increase with the increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God.</p>
                  <p>To these Reasons for growth in Grace I will add
<list>
                        <item>Some <hi>Means</hi> or Helps of it.</item>
                        <item>Some <hi>Marks</hi> of it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Means</hi> of the growth of grace in us, or of our growth in grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Poverty of Spirit.</hi> We should get a clear sight, and deep sense of our own
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:180407:144"/> emptiness or want of grace, and fulness of sin: of our weakness and disability to good, and of the strength of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in us: of our unworthiness, that we are less than the least of all Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And of all the spiritual decayes and defects that are in us.</p>
                  <p>This will make us humble, that is, little, and low, and vile in our own eyes, and so prepare us for more grace. For God gives grace to the humble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. Humility is a concavity, capacity or fit posture of the soul, for receptivity of Christ and Grace in a greater measure. Humble souls are empty Vessels which God will fill; are low plants which God will make to grow. To be nothing in our own eyes is the way to receive all good things, even grace in abundance from God, <hi>God sends the rich and full (i. e.</hi> those that <hi>Laodicea</hi>-like are so in their own conceit) <hi>empty away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Humility makes a soul like <hi>Zacheus</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of stature, fit and forward to climb up into Jesus Christ, the Tree of life, and to gather the fruits thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hungring and thirsting after Christ, and clearer discoveries of him, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate fellowship with him; after the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:180407:144"/> beams, gleams, or shining forth of his face upon our souls, to cause our graces to grow and ripen fast, as the Sun-beams do fruits of the earth. After the pouring forth of his spirit and the fruits thereof more plentifully upon us. And to this end,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We should renew our faith in Christ daily, to receive of his fulness Grace for Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. his <hi>spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. and his power, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>In greater measure; for as we believe in this case, so shall it be done unto us; to be full of grace, of the spirit and of power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And poure out our hearts before him for the same continually, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>and</hi> 138.3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.16. Prayer is a means to procure all reparations, renovations, supplyes, needfull for the soul: For the promise of filling,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.57. Psal. 107.9. Isa. 44.3. Mat. 5.6.</note> satisfying and nourishing is made to the hungry and thirsty. Hungry children grow apace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Means; Get and keep a <hi>soft tender heart,</hi> to make Conscience of the smallest matter; to mourn for the least sin, even for secret Motions or thoughts of evil, or vanity; of slips and faylings in duties; to weep at the very Motes of sin.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:180407:145"/>
                  <p>For Children and Men also, grow so long as their bones are soft, tender, pory; but when they are hard, they cease to grow.</p>
                  <p>Mettal while melted, may easily be moulded according to the mind; but when it is hard, it cannot be formed.</p>
                  <p>A soft heart makes a growing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It is capable of spiritual augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and extension. Travellers through <hi>Baca</hi> a vale of Tears, go from strength to strength, <hi>&amp;c. Psal.</hi> 84. when the heart is enlarged, we will run the way of Gods commandments. They that sow in Tears, reap a harvest of Grace here,<note place="margin">Ps. 119.32.</note> and of joy and glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Hence the most broken-hearted, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians, are the most thriving, growing Christians. But hardness of heart hinders growth, A hard heart will grow no more than a stone.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Means; Wait on God in a <hi>diligent and constant use</hi> of all <hi>Gospel-ordinances,</hi> and holy <hi>duties,</hi> both in publick and private; as hearing, reading, praying, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, receiving the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>We should feed upon Christ in them all, and draw vertue and nourishment from him by them.</p>
                  <p>In every holy duty, let us intend and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:180407:145"/> indeavour to eat spiritual meat, and to drink spiritual drink, to the end we may grow thereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. according to Gods promise, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.24. that unto us that hear (and so that pray, &amp;c.) more shall be given. For these are <hi>pabulum animae</hi> which serve to nourish, cherish, renew, refresh and strengthen the inward man, as daily bread doth the body, and in all these God hath promised to be dew unto <hi>Israel,</hi> to make them grow as the Lillys, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.5.</p>
                  <p>Let us wait for the incomes of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for quickning influence and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dews, to come down upon our souls therein to make them delight themselves in fatness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.2. and for a blessing upon the Means to make us by them rich in grace.</p>
                  <p>Neglecters of duties and ordinances can be no growers in grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Means; <hi>Exercise Grace</hi> upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as faith and love, wisdom and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sincerity and patience, holiness, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For this will increase Grace in you, according to Gods promise, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29. <hi>To him that hath (scil.</hi> in the use of what he hath) <hi>shall more be given, and he shall have abundance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Graces rust or wither, and go to decay
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:180407:146"/> in us for lack of use. They get most grace, who use, or act grace most. They that live the life of grace much, obtain the greatest growth of grace. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of grace is an improvement and increase of grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Means; Beware of, and <hi>shun the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of spiritual growth,</hi> especially, <hi>sin, self, world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To dye unto all these daily, is a means to live to God and grow in grace, and to be renewed in our inward man, day by day.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We should <hi>die unto sin</hi> daily; not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any Lust in our hearts though small or hidden (as pride, envy, passion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) nor indulge any corruption.</p>
                  <p>For that will hinder our souls from growing or thriving in grace as a Leak in a vessel hinders it from filling; as a disease in the body hinders it from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spering: as a back door, or secret way of spending, will hinder a man from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich, and make his estate to waste. Sin in the soul causeth leanness in it, as <hi>Amnons</hi> lust did in his body, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.4. Lust is consumptive to the soul; The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of sin, will eat out all the gains of grace.</p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:180407:146"/>
                  <p>To this end I commend unto you the <hi>daily Practice</hi> of <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of <hi>repentance</hi> or Godly sorrow for all the sins ye commit from day to day. For this hath a renewing force or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, to recover the soul from its falls and lapses; and put it in joynt and frame again.</p>
                  <p>Hence Apostates cannot be renewed into their former state, because they cannot repent of their sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                  <p>Take a daily view of your wayes and account of your selves: renew your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row daily for daily infirmities, and renew your resolutions and watchfulness to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to morrow what hath been amiss in you to day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of <hi>mortification</hi> of sin in you, by applying the power or vertue of Christs death and blood close to your hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. to kill sin in you, and make you conformable unto his death, which will increase conformity in you to his resurrection and life.</p>
                  <p>Sin and grace are like two scales, as the one gets up, the other goes down; like light and darkness, the one goes out, as the other comes in: Like the house
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:180407:147"/> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> the one grew weaker as the other grew stronger. Corruption is wrought out, and Perfection is brought in by degrees.</p>
                  <p>Repentance and mortification are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for a soul to purge out the bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Corruption; and means to strike off its Lusts, which like the Eagles bill, when overgrown, is cumbersome that she cannot take in her meat.</p>
                  <p>So do lusts hinder the soul from taking in spiritual food.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Eagle by beating off the cumbersome part of her bill against a rock, recovereth her eating, and renews her youth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.5. So the soul by Repentance and Mortification renews its health and strength, and grows vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, vegetous and vivacious, of a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful constitution. These are like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision knives to pare off the foreskin of our hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. and to make us Jews inwardly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29.</p>
                  <p>Yea our sinfull Infirmities (as slips, stumbles and falls) may make us more watchfull and circumspect afterwards: and by stumbles a soul may get ground.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Impediment of spiritual growth is <hi>self;</hi> as self-conceit, self-seeking, self-ends,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:180407:147"/> self-righteousness, self-confidence and strength, self-sufficiency. Self destroyes or undoes self, and lyes as a great block, or obstruction in the way to spiritual Augmentation.</p>
                  <p>Let us dye to Self daily; by self-search, scrutiny or Examination; by self-denyal, loathing and abhorrence, by self-judging, humbling and reforming. To lay self low, will exalt and advance Christ and Grace high in the soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Impediment is the <hi>World,</hi> and the things of it, riches, honours, pleasures, preferments, inordinate affections to them, and eager pursuit after them. What quench-coals, pull-backs and stops are these to a Christians progress in grace and godliness, how are they taken off, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged, unedged and impeded thereby. How do many decrease in Spirituals, when they begin to increase in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; and grow little in the eyes of good men, when they grow great in the world.</p>
                  <p>Let us die to the world daily, by aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or weaning of our minds and hearts from it, and from all things in it,—not to love them (as <hi>John</hi> saith) nor set out affections on them, nor seek great things
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:180407:148"/> for our selves in the world: but set loose from them all, as <hi>Davids</hi> soul did, <hi>Psalm</hi> 131.2. and use the world, as if we used it not: and be content with such things as we have, though they be small, few, mean, inferiour to what we desire, and others have. For the world is a great weakning and hinderance to spiritual thriving, and cause of decay to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man: and makes many that have gorgeous, flourishing outsides, to have poor, dwarfish, deformed Spirits.</p>
                  <p>As we should dye to the world, so let us live to Heaven, and get it and things above endeared to our souls; the beauty, excellency, glory, joy and sweetness of them day by day: And to this end, let us mind heavenly things, and set our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things above, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. and drive a Trade for Heaven continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>I might add a fourth Impediment, that is, unsetledness in good courses, to be off and on; and religious by fits only: That which doth not take root, cannot grow, nor bear fruit.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Means: <hi>Afflictions sanctified</hi> encrease the grace of God in us, and help us hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward, and to advance towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:180407:148"/> As the Palm-tree grows higher, and flourisheth more, the more burdens or weights are laid upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The perishings of our outward man, are means of renewing, stablishing, and strengthening our inward man day by day. Hence <hi>Peter</hi> prayes,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.16. 1 Pet. 5.10.</note> —<hi>after ye have suffered a little</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) or <hi>a-while,—the Lord make you perfect, strengthen, stablish, settle you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gods people learn to stand fast by their falls; to get Spiritual gain by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral losses; to become stronger by their weakness; and to be more deeply rooted inwardly, by their shakings outwardly.</p>
                  <p>To the Reasons for, and Means of the growth of Grace, let me add some Marks or Signs of the growth thereof in us, whether it be right and real. Let us examine our selves by these three, <hi>True growth</hi> of Grace, is
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Inward.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>General.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>A growing up into Christ in all things.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Eph 4.15.</note>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>inward</hi> as well as outward, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as well as upwards, radical as fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, in habits as in acts; in the power
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:180407:149"/> of godliness, as in the outward forms and performances: Whereas a Professor may grow great, only and chiefly,
<list>
                        <item>1. In Conceit or Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</item>
                        <item>2. In Shew and outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</item>
                        <item>3. In Profession or outward actings.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this may be but a false growth, like that of a body that is swelled big with a Tympany or Dropsie, caused by wind and waterish humours. Swelling is not (right) growing either in body or soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>general:</hi> If we grow aright, we grow in all things: in Grace as in Gifts; in all the Graces of the Spirit, and in all the Limbs of the New Creature, and in all Obedience.</p>
                  <p>True Growth is total and equal; as in a Child, all parts grow proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and suitably alike, head, hands, feet. So a Christian grows up in all things, in love as well as in faith, in humility as in holiness, in practice as in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:180407:149"/>
                  <p>Whereas to grow in some things, but not in others: as,
<list>
                        <item>1. In Parts or Gifts, but not in Grace.</item>
                        <item>2. In Notions and Speculations, but not in Affections, or in Opinions, not in Action.</item>
                        <item>3. In form, but not in Power of Godliness.</item>
                        <item>1. In Profession, not in Practice.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a partial, unequal, unhandsome Growth, and therefore an unsound Growth: like that Disease of Children, called the Rickets, which makes some parts of the body grow very big, and the rest remain poor, small, feeble, unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unproportional. I fear Spiritual Rickets are too common a disease among Professors in our dayes, who are grown great in their Heads, with high Notions, Conceits and Fancies, but they have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hearts for affection, and little hands for affection, and little feet for motion in the paths of Gods Commandments. When Christians grow aright, they grow in all these things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sign of true growth of Grace, is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:180407:150"/>
                     <hi>to grow up into Christ in all things,</hi> not into our selves.</p>
                  <p>We grow up into Christ:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we make him our first Efficient, the Author or Original of all our good; of what we are, have, or do; that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all from him, both our sap and our fruit, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.5, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If with <hi>Paul,</hi> we count Christ to be our All, or All in All unto us, and our selves to be nothing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.9, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we make him our Last End, and return all to him, all our Gifts, Graces, Performances, and the improvement and encrease of them, to his Service and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.14.</note> and give him due thanks and praise for all.</p>
                  <p>We grow up into our selves, though we grow in Gifts and Performances, even unto Excellency and Admiration of others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we grow or act from our selves, or in our own strength, and look at what we have or do as originally our own; as either procured, or wrought, or deserved by us: and we do not consider, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that whatsoever we have, we have received it from Christ.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we refer all to our selves, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:180407:150"/> make self the end of what we have or do, and take unto our selves the praise of all. <hi>Israel</hi> was an empty Vine,<note place="margin">Hos. 10.1.</note> and grew up into himself, because he brought forth fruit to himself. Whatever comes from Nature or a mans self, it ever builds up it self, and returns to self again.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
                     </note> But what Grace and the growth of it comes from Christ, it drives a man out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by making him humble, and draws him unto Christ, by making him thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we more eye our attainments, than our Imperfections, and look at the one through Multiplying Glasses, which make them more than they are; and at the other through extenuating Glasses, which make them lesser than they are.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>I have desired and endeavoured a long time to grow in Grace, yet I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive little increase thereof in me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Things of greatest excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency are longest in growing before they come to their perfection: See it in man, how many seven years is he growing, before he attain to Virility; and in some Plants and Herbs, which are of excellent use.</p>
                  <p>Whereas things of far less value or
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:180407:151"/> use, grow up sooner to their Pitch: See it in Birds and Beasts, and in worthless things, as Mushromes and Weeds, which spring up suddenly.</p>
                  <p>Now a Child of God or a New Creature (which is the flower of all the Creatures) if he live long, is longest before he come to his perfection, because he must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue growing while he lives, and cannot attain to his full age till he dye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet it may be our own fault that we grow no faster.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>I find not those inward joyes, enlargements, ravishments I have formerly felt, which make me suspect my self, to be in a spiritual Consumption, or to be gone backward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a twofold growth, <hi>Scil.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>Upward.</item>
                        <item>Downward.</item>
                     </list> (which I hinted before) as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of Trees, they grow upward in Summer, more green, tall, leavy, bushy and fairer to the eye.</p>
                  <p>And they grow downward in Winter, more firmly rooted in the earth: the roots striking deeper and further into
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:180407:151"/> the earth; and are more fastned by the Winds, shaking the Trees, loosening the Earth, and causing it to come close about the roots.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of Christians, who at their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and afterwards in their calm and warm Conditions, grow upwards in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and refreshments, in flourishings and forwardness, in Buds, Blossoms and Fruits, in ripe and ready Expressions, Profession and Confession.</p>
                  <p>But afterwards, especially in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or cold Times of Affliction, Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Tentation, they grow down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>scil.</hi> in humility and self-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: in sincerity and truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards parts: in solidity and stability, and in the fear of the Lord that is put into their hearts: They grow more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in beauty, glory and strength, and their hearts are more deeply rooted in Christ. As Husbands love to their Wives is more flashing and sparkling at Marriage, but more solid afterwards, though it lye in a less room.</p>
                  <p>So the affections of Christians are more stirring, and their comforts greater upon their first conversion, because then God wooes and wins their hearts from all
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:180407:152"/> other things to himself, and therefore offers them better and sweeter delights than ever they had from the creatures, the sight and taste whereof makes them leave all to cleave to him. Then they easily find and overcome God; he sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graciously manifesting himself to them. And their joy and delight is yet the greater at such a time, because then every thing seems new to them. God hath given them a new mind, new heart, new life: They have gotten new hopes, new kindred, new rewards, and are escaped out of the hands and power of their spiritual enemies: which things much affect them, and the more for the newness of them. New things being most taking and delightful. God deals with Christians suitably to their several ages, as men do by their children. As little children may be led whether one will with sensible objects, as Apples or Spice: So those that are Babes in Christ, (but young Converts) are led by sense and feeling of Gods love, and inward joy: But afterwards when they are grown up from childhood, to be men in Christ, they enter upon a different estate, and then feeling many times fails, God withdraws
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:180407:152"/> comforts, hides his face, and puts them upon it to <hi>walk by faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. and not by sense. And to prove his love to them, rather by Arguments drawn from Gods free-grace and faithful promises, and from former experience of his mercies, than from divine manifestations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, raptures. And then they may be put to wrastle hard with God, and wait long for what they desire. God in these respects dealing, as a prudent Father who will not kiss and dandle his Son, nor shew such signs of affection when he is grown up to be a man, as he did when he was a Child: but walks more reservedly (and sometimes more austerely) towards him, concealing his love from him, to keep him within streighter bounds of filial obedience.</p>
                  <p>Now if we do not observe this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of age in Christians, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents thereof, we may conclude against our selves that we grow backwards in faith, because we go not forward in feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whereas Faith is strongest, when feeling is weakest. Mistake of age caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sometimes a fear of decay even where there is a growth.</p>
                  <p>Thus Christians may grow one way,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:180407:153"/> though they do not grow another: but whether it be upward or downward, they grow Heaven-ward.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Excellency of Grace appears as in the Nature, Causes and Effects thereof, so in the <hi>subject</hi> or propriety of it: that it is proper and peculiar to Gods Elect, whom he hath ordained to life from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and whom Christ hath effectually redeemed, and will save eternally: it is a Spiritual Blessing conferred as a mark of special favour from God upon them all, and them only, that shall have glory and upon no others. Which,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Makes them to be what they are (as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am</hi>) For grace is the very form of a Christian, which essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates him as he is a Christian, to be a Saint, and a Believer, truly and really good, though imperfectly here. It is the soul (as it were) of the soul; and makes a man to be actually the Child of God, and an Heir of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which distinguisheth them, as a characteristical property from all others. Grace discriminates the Elect from the Reprobate; the Spiritual from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the righteous from the wicked; the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:180407:153"/> seed of the woman from the seed of the Serpent, Christs Sheep from Goats, his Wheat from Tares, Gold from Dross.</p>
                  <p>Hence Grace is called the faith of Gods Elect, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. The Patience of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.12. The wisdom of the just, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p>God gives his Children Grace for a double Portion as they are his first-born; or for an inheritance as they are his <hi>Isaacs;</hi> for a Badge or Cognizance to be known by, as they are his Servants; for a sparkling lustre or splendor, as they are his Jewels; for a special Mark, as they are the Sheep of his pasture, and vessels unto honour, meet for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters use: for Tickets as they are his strangers, or brood of Travellers, to pass through the Enemies Countrey here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and to enter into Heaven and Glory above.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> gave all that he had unto <hi>Isaac:</hi> but unto the Sons of the Concubines which he had, he gave Gifts and sent them away unto the East Countrey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5, 6. So God gives grace to his Elect only, but common gifts to others, as well as to them.</p>
                  <p>Now Common Gifts being dispensed
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:180407:154"/> by God promiscuously to all, do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the good from the bad, nor the elected from the rejected, yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not Heathens from Christians. We see many that excell in gifts are void of grace; that even bad men have good parts, yea, even such men as are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to grace, and to the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and opposers of the Means of Grace and Salvation, and of those that are gracious; and that employ their parts against the same.</p>
                  <p>Moral Vertues suffered the Stoicks (who were the chiefest of Heathens, and had, as some say, the highest Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about vertue) to be bitter opposers of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.18.</p>
                  <p>Many exact Moralists of strict and austere lives; or that were devout in a natural, formal, superstitious, or will-worshipping way, have been cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of Christ and Christians, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent opposers of pure Religion and holy Worship: as <hi>Paul</hi> was whilest a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, though unblamable in his life, and very devout in his way; what havock and spoil made he of the Church of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6.<note place="margin">Acts 22.4.</note> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and honourable Women (who had
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:180407:154"/> embraced the Jewish Religion, and were strict and zealous in Legal Observances, and in their Traditional Worship of God) they with the chief men of the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia,</hi> at the Instigation of the Jews, out of blind zeal against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, raised persecution against <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and expelled them out of their Coasts, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.50.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Excellency of Grace appears as in the Subject, so in the <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of it, as

                  <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Duration</hi> of it both in it self and to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace in it self is permanent, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, that fadeth not away, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting; a birth that shall never dye, a plant that will not wither, but grow up untill it attain to its full height in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Only Grace can be called durable Riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.18. it being the unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grace is durable to all that have received it in Truth, so as it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally theirs, and remain with them for ever. It cannot be utterly lost by them,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:180407:155"/> nor taken wholly from them, by the Devil, the World, the Flesh, or Death; because it is kept in safe hands for them, <hi>Our life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. And <hi>we are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Grace</hi> is that <hi>good part,</hi> which being once chosen by us, shall never be taken from us, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>good work,</hi> which God having begun in us, will perfect untill the day of Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. We may be confident of it, Christ who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 1.11. Isa. 26.12.</note> will be the finisher of our faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and of all other Graces in us; that as he performeth all things for us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.2. so he will perfect that which concerneth us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.8. Grace is Christs business in us, which he will not do to the halves, nor leave in the midst, but raise it up to its full height, or carry on to consummation, and lay on the top-stone thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>great gift of God,</hi> which God will never repent of his giving to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. and therefore never take it away from us; nor leave our souls whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:180407:155"/>4. That <hi>seed of God,</hi> which takes and keeps possession of the soul for God, so that he cannot sin, to wit, as the wicked doth, wittingly, willingly, impenitently, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. Or so as quite to leave God and lose his soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Grace is a <hi>Means of making our Calling and Election sure</hi> to us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. &amp; 8, 9, 10, 11. Both which would fall and be frustrate to us if Grace should fail in us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Apostles call the Graces of the Spirit <hi>better things,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. <hi>that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company salvation</hi> better, than the best gifts (which men may have, and yet lose, and themselves also) because these will abide with us for ever, and be concomitants of our souls to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Common Gifts are perishing, fading things in themselves. Men that have them may lose them, and fall away and perish everlastingly, as Apostates do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>to</hi> 9. As they are gotten by industry and exercise, so they may be lost, by idleness, negligence and loosness. Common gifts and abilities are not sure to men, therefore their Calling and Election can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made sure by them; because they are not the proper immediate effects, nor inseparable concomitants thereof: nor
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:180407:156"/> do they accompany salvation certainly and necessarily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Stella ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens non est stella.</note>Common Gifts are like flowers that will fade; like Stars (or Meteors rather) that will fall.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of Grace both in it self and in us. Hence Grace is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed into Gods Image, we are changed from glory to glory; that is, from one degree of grace to another. Grace makes us like the Kings daughter, all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.13. adorned in the inner man with faith, love, hope, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and glorious without also by the exercise, or bearings forth of the same in our lives. Wisdom makes the face to shine, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.1. Holiness makes us shine as lights in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. and our good works to shine as beams of light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. And our lives to be (as one saith) a very Heaven, sparkling with variety of Graces, as with so many bright Stars and glorious splendor: When Grace enters into the heart, it may be said unto it, arise, shine for thy light is come, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</p>
                  <p>As Gods Sanctity is his glory (therefore he is said to be glorious in holiness,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:180407:156"/>
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11.) So nothing makes us so truly glorious as holiness, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gracious. It sets a Crown and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem of beauty upon our heads; for herein a man most resembles the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his maker.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Saints are the most excellent ones upon earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. of excellent spirits,<note place="margin">Prov. 12.26. Heb. 11.38.</note>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.27. and more excellent than their Neighbours wheresoever they dwell; the Lords Worthies of whom the World is not worthy. Grace makes a man amiable and venerable in the eyes of others. What great reverence, respect and honour hath grace gained to Godly persons, not only from their brethren or fellow-Saints, but even from natural, moral, yea sometimes from wicked men; as to <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Herod,</hi> whom he feared and reverenced, because he was a just and holy man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. Holiness is majestical even in the Saints, which gets them honour in the Conscience of their greatest Enemies; as it did to <hi>Abraham</hi> from the Hittites, amongst whom he was as a Prince of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.6. to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 41.38. to <hi>Daniel</hi> from <hi>Nebuchadneezar</hi> and <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 2.48. <hi>and</hi> 6.28.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 43.4.</note>Grace makes a soul precious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, lovely and delectable unto God; it draws the eye and heart of God most towards it. Grace is the Fathers image stamped upon his adopted Sons; which he takes most pleasure to behold.<note place="margin">Psal. 147.11. &amp; 149.4. Prov. 11.20.</note> It is a glass wherein God looketh himself and seeth his likeness. God takes special Notice of the least seed, bud, or spark of grace in whomsoever it is.</p>

                  <p>God overlooks many Infirmities where he sees grace and sincerity, as he did in <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>

Hence God measures the Saints actions by their affections.</p>
                  <p>God values Grace above all created good, or whatsoever his hand hath made, whether it be substance or quality; and he prizeth his Children that have it above all other persons in the World.</p>

                  <p>How highly did Christ commend and admire his spouse for her grace, beauty, excellency and delight, which he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly describes according to the divers Members of her Body, as Eyes, Teeth, Lips, Temples, Neck, Breasts, &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.1. <hi>to</hi> 6. <hi>and Chap.</hi> 7.1. <hi>to</hi> 10. from her feet upwards to her head, her Graces ravished his heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9, 10. and made her voice sweet and countenance comely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.14. and her pleasant for delights. Upon the account hereof Christ calls his Church, his <hi>Love, Dove, Fair one, and saith, she is all fair,</hi> and <hi>there is no spot in her,</hi> Chap. 4.7.</p>
                  <p>God approves of Moralities and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that are in natural men, because they have some kind or degrees of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them.

                  <p>But only Grace is the great Jewel in Gods eye; and the Godly are his chief delight.</p>

Worldly goods <hi>cannot make men good,</hi> or better: but many are made worse thereby, more covetous, proud, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, scornful, carnal, cruel, and more hardened in evil and against good. A house full of Silver and Gold, cannot purchase one dram or mite of grace for the heart. They that will be rich, fall into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtfull Lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. These cannot save men,</p>

                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="4">4. These puff men up with pride, and make their spirits like bodies swel'd with Tympanies, or bladders blown or bubbles, that is skins of water, fill'd with wind: high and lofty.</p>
                  <p>Grace excells all beauty, bravery, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and glistering splendor of the World in any kind (which are the great <hi>Diana's</hi> of the people of the World) as the Lillies of the Field excelled <hi>Solomon</hi> in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:180407:160"/> all his Glory, when he sate on his stately Throne, and in his Royal Robes. God puts more glory upon a flowre of Grace, then Art and Cost can put upon the most spendid Grandees and magnificent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs in the World.</p>
                  <p>The patient, couragious, suffering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were more glorious than their high and stately Persecuters, as those of the Church were whom <hi>Herod</hi> stretched forth his hands to vex, more glorious than he, when he sate upon his Throne, arayed in Royal apparrel, and the people Deified him, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.12, 21, 22. Poor, sore, begging <hi>Lazarus,</hi> through Grace excell'd the rich man in glory, who was cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen, and fared sumptuously every day, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> are said to have entred into the place of hearing, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:180407:161"/>3. Grace excells all <hi>Pleasures</hi> of the flesh and of the World, all delicacies which gratifie the senses, and all indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in Meats, Drinks, Apparel, Sports and other delights.</p>
                  <p>How much cost, time and pains do Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants lay out upon their pleasures, for which they must give account to God one day:</p>
                  <p>These are 1. But <hi>shallow,</hi> superficial, they reach but a little way, skin deep, a man may soon see an end of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (if any) that is in them: they flush the face and tickle the flesh and the fancy, but do not fill or satisfie the heart: they soon glut or tire even pleasure-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers themselves, and cause a loathing sometimes as Quailes did to <hi>Israel, Numb.</hi> 11.20. and make them to desire either new, or more, or the same over again: they are fallacious and disappointfull, promising much and performing little, <hi>even in laughter, the heart is sorrowful,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 14.13. The carnal pleasures and jollity of the wicked are frothy and flashy; accompanied with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gripings of fear, and grief and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of heart; what one saith of an evil wife, is true of these, a man may sooner
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:180407:161"/> have have a cold armfull than a warm heartfull of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But <hi>short</hi> for continuance,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.25.</note> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but for a season: they are like the crackling of Thorns under a pot, soon in and soon out; which suddenly vanish not leaving any solid content or joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. Their last at longest is but here. <hi>Dives</hi> in his life time received his good things (all his pleasures and delights,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.25.</note> which were his Heaven); then followed his Hell, and Torments, without ease or end for ever.<note place="margin">Iam. 5.5.</note> The rich men <hi>James</hi> speaks of, lived in pleasures and were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but on the earth, here and no where else. Those that live in pleasures may outlive their joy and happiness, and then enter into pain and misery to be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and yet <hi>ever</hi> endured.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But <hi>sad</hi> in effects and consequents; for pleasures do often,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Fatten mens hearts and make them gross, senseless and stupid; to grow past feeling;<note place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note> as the hearts of the proud are which pleasures make as fat as grease, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.70. but cannot fill them. The Philosopher observes that fat-hearted people are dull and stupid; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes of the Asse, (which is of all
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:180407:162"/> Beasts the dullest) that it hath the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test heart. Fat things are less sensible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Make men uncharitable, unaffected with others miseries as those that drunk Wine in bowles were with <hi>Josephs</hi> mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. yea oppressive and cruel, as <hi>Dives</hi> that rich Glutton that fared deliciously every day, denyed a crumb to <hi>Lazarus:</hi> and the rich men in, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.5, 6. who lived in pleasure, and nourished their hearts as in a day of slaughter, they condemned and killed the just.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The pleasures of this life choake the seed of the Word (as in the Thorny ground, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14.) that it brings no fruit unto perfection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Pleasures are food or fuel to Lusts, yea and bellows also to inflame them. Lust is but the last end (as one saith) and consummation of all pleasure, to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and satisfied by them. Hence Lusts and pleasures must be served (as Masters by us) else they are starved.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note> Pleasures are many as the Quailes to <hi>Israel,</hi> meat for their Lusts, but they cause leanness in their souls, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.15.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Pleasures and joy to the wicked end in pain and sorrow; the end of this
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:180407:162"/> honey will be Gall and bitterness to them. <hi>Solomon</hi> asserts it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> shall find it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7.</p>
                  <p>Carnal pleasures are like Bees, which bring honey in their mouths, but stings in their Tailes, which they stick and leave behind them in the consciences of men; these stings may breed worms to torment them for ever, which will not dye, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.44.</p>
                  <p>But the pleasures and joyes which Grace gives a soul here, are heart-refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, satisfying-ravishing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce pretious effects in it; and will certainly procure fulness of joy and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of pleasures hereafter, at Gods right hand for evermore; when the delights of Grace, shall be swallowed up in the gulf of glory unto Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thus Grace doth infinitely surpass all carnal, worldly pleasures, in operations, dimensions and duration.</p>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="1">1. To open Heaven for us (which was shut against us for our sins, as Paradise was against <hi>Adam</hi> when he had sinned)
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:180407:167"/> and to make a free passage for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in. Christ by his own blood entered in thither, having obtained eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To take Possession of Heaven for us, in our very Names, stead and right; as a Guardian takes possession for Heirs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, or in their Minority, as we are here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To assure us that we shall go after him, and follow this our fore-runner to Heaven, in due time, as Members to our Head, and as a Spouse to our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>Christs Ascension adds much to the strengthening of our faith in him,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.19, 20.</note> for the fulfilling of Promises: and it makes our Hope as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, because cast within the Vail whither Christ is entered for us, that we should be made partakers of the Happiness there enjoyed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To draw up our hearts to Heaven after Christ, to make us mind heavenly things, and set our affections on things above, and have our conversation in Heaven; by the Influence of Christs As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension upon our souls; to make them ascend continually Heaven-ward; and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:180407:168"/> desire to be there with Jesus Christ (he being so nearly and dearly related to us,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> as our Head, Husband, sweetest Friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as best of all for us. The hearts of men and women are much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out towards the place whither their dear friends are gone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To comfort our hearts against all troubles, sorrows, disgrace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which we are obnoxious in this world, <hi>John</hi> 14.1, 2. because Christ in Heaven prepareth rest, and honour, and joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> enough for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In his Session</hi> at the right hand of God; which may be considered in two respects:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it imports the highest degree of Christs Exaltation, and the sublimity of his Power, Majesty, Glory and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, so it is peculiar to the person of Christ the Mediator, and his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive only, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.69. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3, 13.</p>

                  <p>These Graces of the Spirit are very sweet as they are in the Saints; Hence the Church is said to be perfumed with Myrrh and Frankincense, with all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Merchant, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. and the smell of her Oyntments is better then all Spices, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.10, 11.

                  <p>We should pray that our Nose, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Instrument of smelling or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath) may be as the Spouses Nose, as the Tower of Lebanon which looketh toward <hi>Damascus, Cant.</hi> 7.4. for our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular sagacity in smelling the choice flowers and fragrant Spices of his Name and Graces. <hi>Lebanon</hi> (as some say) was a Hill and Forrest full of sweet and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Trees and Shrubs: and so the Tower built in <hi>Lebanon</hi> must needs be compassed about with sweet smelling odours, to the great refreshing and delight of such as dwelt in it, or passed by it.</p>

                  <p>We may ground our expectation of the manifestation of his love to us, upon those precious Promises, John 14.21, 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and

                  <p n="1">I. Our Faith in him, or a stedfast and constant recumbence upon him, above all others, and for all things. To believe in him, though we do not see him, as the elect strangers did, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Yea, though he slay us, which <hi>Job</hi> resolved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.15. his faith was stronger than death▪ Let him see we live by faith in the Son of God for all things pertaining to life and godliness, to Grace and Glory.</p>
                  <p>Faith is very taking with Christ. He takes special notice of it, and of them that have it. He knoweth them that trust in him, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.7. He takes great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency

                  <p>Let us look unto Jesus, not only by faith, but for faith also, as he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of our faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. that he would increase and strengthen it in us;<note place="margin">Rom. 15.13.</note> and fill us with all joy and peace in believing.</p>

                  <p>For we are the Temple of Christ: and Christ knocketh at the door of our hearts to have entrance; and if we open to him (which he requires of his Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.) he will come in to us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. for it is his promise.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.

                  <p n="5">5. We should manifest our love to Christ, as our Husband and King, by keeping our hearts intire and peculiar for him alone, as a retiring room,<note place="margin">Hos. 3.3.</note> or lodging; as a bed to lye in, or Throne to Rule in alone.</p>
                  <p>And by keeping out all competitors and Corrivals with him, as the World, Lust and Self.</p>

                  <p>We should lock up our hearts against all these, and give the Key into Christs hand to keep and open to himself alone, and come in when he pleaseth.</p>

                  <p>We should manifest our love to Christ upon all occasions, and abound in labours of love towards his Name, cause and members.

                  <p>We shall lose nothing by loving Christ, for then Christ will love us and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also, and will manifest himself to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. He and his Father will come unto us, and make their abode with us, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. We shall get for a recompence, a hundred fold more love from Christ than we have to give unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>We should covet earnestly the Grace of love to Christ, that all which proceeds from us towards him may be stamped with an Impress of love, and taste of the sweet and savoury relishes thereof.</p>
                  <p>To this end, Let us pray and believe upon the account of Gods promises of Heart-circumcision, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. and of giving us the spirit of Love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. and labour to feel Christs love in our hearts which will fill our hearts with love
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:180407:182"/> to Christ. We have many Motives to manifest as much love to Christ as we can, as our propriety in him, because he is ours, and he loved us first; and for the savour of his good ointments, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Our delight in Christ, as the Head of our joy, for the object of it, and as the Root or fountain of our joy, for derivation or infusion thereof into us. Tell Christ, or let him see,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we never expect any solid, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying solace or gladness in our souls untill Christ put it in: that we account it our chiefest joy to injoy him, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him; and our greatest grief to want him, and the comforts of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that this makes us go mourning, (like <hi>Job</hi>) without the Sun;<note place="margin">Job 30.16.</note> or as a wife that wants her husband; that Christ alone rejoyceth our hearts, and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all creature-delights to be empty, flashy, unsatisfactory and vanishing, and that they leave our hearts sad: that our joy ebbs or flows, waxeth or weanes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he comes to us, or goes from us; as he manifests himself to us, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws and hides himself from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we rejoyce not only in him but in his, in all that is near and dear
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:180407:182"/> unto him, as in his Name and Attributes, in his love and great goodness;<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> in his Law or word and worship, that is our delight as it was <hi>Davids:</hi> in his Saints, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. in the success of his Gospel, and interest and promotion of his Kingdom and glory, however things go with us, as <hi>John</hi> did, chap. 3.29, 30. —<hi>This my joy is fulfilled, —He must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, but I must decrease. scil.</hi> as a Star at the rising of the Sun. That we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be outshined by others in gifts or labours; to be small and despised, disparaged and diminished, so Christ may have more glory thereby; and things may go well with <hi>Sion,</hi> and can be glad there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: that our Hearts desire to rejoyce in him, in the greatest afflictions as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.17, 18. when the Fig-tree doth not blossome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when Fruits fail from Trees and Fields, and Flocks from the Fold; yea to rejoyce in our sufferings for Christ as the Apostles did, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Our Holiness, which we should manifest by our constant care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep our minds and hearts pure in the sight of God, to suppress the first motions and stirrings of corruptions within us, even of those to which our
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:180407:183"/> Natures are most inclined; as well as our outward man from the breaking forth of sin in our lives; to keep our selves as from our iniquities,<note place="margin">Psal. 18.23.</note> so unspotted of the World: to do no evil, wittingly or willingly; but to humble our selves low before the Lord for all that is amiss in our thoughts, words or deeds. Christ gives repentance as well as remission of sin to <hi>Israel, Act.</hi> 5.31. he will have no fellowship with impenitent persons; if we confess our sins, he is faithfull and just to forgive us our sins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. For sin separates between Christ and us,<note place="margin">Isa. 59.2.</note> and makes him hide his face, and turn away his ears from us, and causeth distance and estrangement, and breaks off all fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. For Christ is light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. sin is darkness, the blackness of darkness. Christ is righteous yea righteousness, sin is unrighteousness; what fellowship hath light with darkness? hath righteousness with unrighteousness? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. we must walk in the light as he is in the light, else no fellowship with the Father or the Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we lye, and say (and do) not the truth; we are children of falshood both in word and deed.</p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:180407:183"/>
                  <p>Purity is a preparative to our intimate fellowship with Christ to behold his face, for the pure in heart shall see God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p>To hear his voice, for he will speak peace to his Saints or holy ones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 85.8.</p>
                  <p>To converse or commune with Christ as a man with his friend, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16, 18. If we put away the evil of our thinkings sayings and doings, he will say to us, come now and let us reason together. If we come out from among sinners and touch no unclean thing, he will receive us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. God tenders fellowship to us upon the terms of Purity. Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Christ and with Sin are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, extreamly inconsistent and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>To know the mind of Christ, for his secrets are with them that fear him; for they depart from iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>To have the breathings of the spirit of Christ upon our souls, his graces and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in them, as a pretious liquor in a clean vessel.</p>
                  <p>To feel the love of Christ in our hearts, which those are most sensible of that hate all sin.</p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:180407:184"/>
                  <p>For Christ loveth and delighteth in pureness of heart, wherever he seeth it; This is the way to make us Christs fair ones, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.10. <hi>and</hi> 4.7.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Our Obedience, in resolutions and endeavours to keep Christs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alway,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.112.</note> even unto the end, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cost us; to have respect to them all (as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.6.) without partiality: to do Christs will and our works with diligence and delight. Let Christ see that we have upon our Hearts, not only the Bent or Bias of a strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but the power or obligation of a stedfast purpose and oath to universal obedience,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.106.</note> as <hi>David</hi> had — <hi>I have sworn and I will perform it, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Christ makes our keeping of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be a demonstration of our love to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15, 21, 23. Therefore let us come to Christ to receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or directions in every thing, and say as <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 9.6.</note> Lord what wilt thou have me to do? God the Father charged <hi>Israel</hi> to obey Christs voice, and not provoke him, when they had fellowship with him as their conductor in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.<note place="margin">Exod. 23.21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Our Patience.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:180407:184"/>1. In submitting,<note place="margin">Job 2.10.</note> or suffering evils at the hand of God quietly and silently, in bearing Christs cross, lying down at Christs feet, and saying with <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15, 26. Psal. 39 9.</note>
                     <hi>here am I Lord, do to me as seemeth good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee:</hi> and <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth because thou didst it:</hi> in resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our will into Gods will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In waiting on Jesus Christ, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his leisure untill the time of his coming and refreshing to our souls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making haste, thinking much, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or desponding, or grudging at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes. This is to abide for him many dayes. Waiting on (and for) God,<note place="margin">Hos. 3.3.</note> was <hi>Davids</hi> profession and practice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 62.5. Say with <hi>David,</hi> and now Lord what wait I for,<note place="margin">Psal. 39.7.</note> my hope is in thee, my expectation is from thee, <hi>Scil.</hi> of communion with thee.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Our Humility and meekness, in spirit and speech, in looks and carriage. A humble lowly posture is most taking with Christ, who is most high; because it is his Impress upon us, and makes us like unto him. —<hi>I am</hi> (saith he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.) <hi>meek and lowly in heart.</hi> A humble heart is Christs house, yea Heaven upon Earth, wherein he chuseth to dwell
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:180407:185"/> and to solace himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.15. How acceptable have Gods eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants been to him upon the account of their Humility; as <hi>Abraham,</hi> who said I am but dust and ashes. And <hi>Jacob</hi> that said, I am less than the least of all thy Mercies: And <hi>David</hi> who said, Who am I, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself no body: and <hi>Paul</hi> who counted himself to be nothing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. And <hi>John</hi> Baptist, who thought himself not worthy to bear Christs Shoos, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. And <hi>Job</hi> who abhorred himself, and repented in dust and ashes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. God the Father hath called us to the fellowship of Jesus Christ as he is our Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.9.</note> which obligeth us to walk humbly, or to humble our selves to walk with him:<note place="margin">Mic. 7.8.</note> to serve our Lord with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential fear, and to rejoyce before him with holy trembling: to condescend or stoop very low to take up his cross.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Our sincerity, in approving our hearts and wayes unto Christ: in seeking his glory in every thing, not our selves in any thing; and in giving him the honour and praise of all we have or do.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.17.</note> For he desires truth in our inward parts, and hath pleasure in uprightness,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:180407:185"/> and such as are upright in their way are his delight.<note place="margin">Prov. 11.20. Ioh. 1.47.</note> Christ commended <hi>Nathanael</hi> for it with an <hi>Ecce</hi>— Behold an Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite indeed, in whom is no guile. The upright love Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Our knowledge and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our knowledg of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Notional in our minds, of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the properties of them: of his offices and the acts of them: of his seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral states, of humiliation and exaltation, and of the condition and operations or benefits of both: of his truths, wayes, and ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fiducial, to trust him with our hearts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Affectional, to embrace him with our dearest affections.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Experimental, from our spiritual seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, handling of him, the word of life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. and from our observation of his various and gracious dealings with us, all along.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Augmentative, to grow in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. this is to follow on to know the Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our acknowledgment of Christ.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:180407:186"/> We must not only know Christ, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess or hold forth our knowledge of him, which is to confess Christ before men, to give testimony to his Gospel, truths and wayes, and whatever hath the stamp of Christ upon them. To this we are his Witnesses, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.10.</p>
                  <p>It pleaseth Christ well, as to know, so to be known of those that are his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.14. as his sheep, spouse, people.</p>
                  <p>And Christ will confess such before his Father which is in Heaven,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.32.</note> and before the Angels of God: that these have been his companions and his friends, his <hi>Noahs, Henocks,</hi> &amp;c. that have walked and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, as two that are agreed. Christ will own them and avouch them before all the World to be his people; and will say to them at the last day, come ye blessed of my Father inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Our suitableness of Disposition and of carriage to Jesus Christ. For this is the ground of friendship and fellowship; the procreant and conservant cause thereof.</p>
                  <p>We contract familiarity with such as suit our spirits; and we cannot close with those, that are of a cross or contrary
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:180407:186"/> Temper to us. For fellowship is a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that is made up of consent of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and of concord of Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Jarring spirits make no melody of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as jarring strings marr Musique. Make no friendship with an angry man, saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 22.24. and with a furious man thou shalt not go, because it cannot be kept with such; their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness and fury is repugnant to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and fellowship, and makes them knotty and crooked pieces, rough and uneven, they will not lye flat, nor close well in and juncture of amity and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity. The grain of our dispositions must lye Christ-wards, and our spirits must be tuned sweetly to him, to be of the same Mind with Jesus Christ in every thing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. to love what he loveth, and to hate what he hateth; to choose and do the things that please him, which is the way to walk worthy of him unto all well-pleasing, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. else we can have no intimate fellowship with him. If we be correspondents unto him in our spirits and course, we shall be compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with him in comfortable communion. We should be very tender of, and affected with his glory; and be sensible of, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:180407:187"/> mourn for the dishonour which is offered to his Name. Put on, towards Christ, the affections of <hi>David,</hi> who wept Rivers of Tears because men kept not Gods Law, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.836, 138, 139. of <hi>Elijah,</hi> who was very jealous for the Lord God of Hosts, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. Gods honour was as dear to him as a Wives fidelity is to her Husband: and of <hi>Phinehas</hi> Wife, that holy Woman who dyed for grief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the dishonour which came to God and his Ark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Our Fellowship of Intercourse with Christ may be exercised mutually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us in the way of,

                  <p>In all holy duties and ordinances we should labour to have fellowship with Christ, not only in the outward form, but in the inward power and efficacy of them; not only in the light but in the life and heat of them, in the bark, bone or shell, but in the sap, kernel or marrow of them: to inlarge our Hearts in them all, as in activity for (or towards) Christ, to set all the power of our souls on work therein; so in receptivity for our selves, to take in all spiritual blessings, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated therein from Christ to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>In these, as in the banquetting house, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.45. or Wine-Celler, where he stayes us with Flaggons and comforts us with Apples: Christ and the soul feast together.

                  <p n="4">IV. As in a way of Ordinances, so of Providence, we should exercise fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the Lord; and therein four wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By eying and observing God in them all; his efficiency and the appearance of his several Attributes therein, as his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:180407:192"/> power, goodness, faithfulness, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By considering wisely of his doings, <hi>Psal.</hi> 64.9. Searching to find out the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial cause thereof, and Gods end therein. Why he doth so and so, <hi>Job</hi> 10.10. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By being affected continually, as he gives us occasion in his Providence: Our hearts ecchoing to Gods hand: or answering to Gods several Dispensations, with suitable dispositions or affections, which is to sanctifie the Lord God in our hearts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By improving all his providential doings to a holy use; giving him the praise and glory, and due thanks for them all.</p>
                  <p>Motives to Communion with Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. This is the best fellowship of all, in six Respects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the excellency and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of it. To live in fellowship with Christ is to live at the highest rate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, next to Heaven, yea as in a corner of Heaven, or in Heaven upon
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:180407:192"/> Earth; To live in the highest Region of Christianity, above all Winds, Storms, Tempests, Commotions and Disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces caused here below. Above all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and creature-comforts in the world, natural or Civil: It is the life of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; an Evangelical, yea, Angelical and Celestial life, in comparison whereof, the most men and women are dead, even while they live. Communion with Christ is the cream, flower and quintescence of all communions.</p>
                  <p>Such as have fellowship with Christ, may say with Christ,<note place="margin">John 4.32, 34.</note> we have meat to eat the world knows not of. It is our meat (and drink also) to do Christs will, and finish his; and with <hi>Paul,</hi> Thus <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.26.</p>
                  <p>Communion with Christ will put us into the same posture with the Woman (that is the Church in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>scil.</hi> to be cloathed with the Sun (of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or with the Righteousness of Christ the Son of God, and the Sun of his Church) and to have the Moon (that is, the world and all sublunary things) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet.</p>
                  <p>This is the way to live in Christs sight, to see his face, as we are capable here,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:180407:193"/> to walk in the light of his countenance, and to hear his voice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Satisfaction: Fellowship with Christ gives a soul sound, solid and full content, acquiescence, comfort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: it terminates the desires of the heart, and makes it say with <hi>Jacob,</hi> I have enough, I have all. It is pure without mixture of bitter or heart-sadning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients; it is all hony, no gall, or wormwood. He that cometh to me, saith Christ, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst, that is, he that hath communion with me, shall be fully satisfied with me, and not desire any thing but Christ, or in comparison of Christ, but only more of Christ, or the full fruition of him in glory.</p>
                  <p>All other fellowships (natural and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) are empty and unsatisfactory, but bitter sweets, accompanied with vanity and vexation of Spirit, and a bitterness in comparison of this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For Duration. Fellowship in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Civil; yea, in spiritual Relations is uncertain sometimes and inconstant, or momentary; but <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this side the Grave, at the farthest.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:180407:193"/> yea, even during this present time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They may dye, and the one be taken away from the other, as <hi>Davids</hi> dear friend <hi>Jonathan</hi> was from him, and his Child and his Parents; and as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wife. Our relations may soon be laid in the dust, then all our fellowship with them will perish.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or though they live, they may change their mind, decay in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fall off from us. Many of Christs Disciples went back,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.66. 2 Tim. 4.10.</note> and walked no more with him. Some of <hi>Pauls</hi> Hearers deserted him, as <hi>Demas,</hi> and all they in <hi>Asia,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the <hi>Galatians</hi> kept not so close to <hi>Paul</hi> in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and in communion as they might and ought, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.15, 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Johns</hi> Hearers did the like to him, <hi>John</hi> 5.35. Distance and estrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may break off the Fellowship of other Relations, as between <hi>David,</hi> and his lovers, friends, kinsmen, acquaintance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.11. So as he was forgotten as a dead man out of mind, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.11, 12. like a broken vessel, out of use, esteem and request: between <hi>Job</hi> and his brethren, acquaintance, kinsfolks and familiar friends, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.13, 14. and his
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:180407:194"/> domesticks, his servants and his Wife, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea, Friends may turn enemies to us, <hi>Jobs</hi> most intimate friends, (to whom he communicated his secrets) abhorred him: they whom he loved set themselves against him to do him hurt, <hi>Job</hi> 19.19. He called them all miserable comforters, <hi>Job</hi> 16.2. Who instead of lightning his burden, laid more load on him: So did <hi>Ahitophel, Davids</hi> own familiar friend in whom he trusted, to him, <hi>Psalm</hi> 41.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55.13, 14. and <hi>Judas</hi> to Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.23. All <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> familiar friends watched for his halting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. Even his Brethren, and the Sons of his Father dealt treacherously with him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.6. A friend, as <hi>Plato</hi> said, is a mutable creature. A man may have no fast hold, nor strong assurance of fellowship long with any creature.</p>
                  <p>Trust ye not in a friend (saith the Prophet)—a mans enemies are the men of his own house,<note place="margin">Mic. 7 5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>Jeremy</hi> gives the like caution, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.4, 5. But our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Christ is constant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and perpetual: because it is with him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who is immortal, and liveth for
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:180407:194"/> ever, called therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Tim 1.17.</note> the King of Ages.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who is immutable as to himself, so in his love and kindness to us; and in his communion with us. For with him is no variableness, nor shadow of turning. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the same yesterday, to day and for ever. Our fellowship with Christ is like the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day here; and this will continue in glory unto eternity, when all other Relations, and the fellowship of them are expired:<note place="margin">Lu. 20.35.</note> When there shall be no marrying, nor giving in Marriage, yet the Relation and Communion between the Lamb and the Bride his Wife shall be consummated and perpetuated in Heaven. Blessed are they that are called to that Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is the best fellowship for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the loss or want of all other Relations and of the comfort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in them; as of Parents and Children, of Husbands and Wives, of friends by death, or by defection.</p>
                  <p>All may be abundantly made up in, supplied, yea, exceeded by our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Jesus Christ. If a man place
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:180407:195"/> his chief comfort and joy in any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and God dissolve that by death: how miserable is he; but if he enjoy one super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively better, as this communion with Christ is, and as he can never lose, this will make amends for all, yea, an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus: this will make him happy for ever.</p>
                  <p>I may add, that our fellowship with Christ will comfort us amidst all our losses, crosses, sorrows and troubles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is the best fellowship for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to our dissolution, or solemn change, to leave the world and all our relations, possessions, interests and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in it; and to go to Christ, which is best of all for us. For all such, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such who have fellowship with Christ in Grace on Earth, shall have fellowship with him in glory in Heaven: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the Inchoation, the latter is the consummation of our communion with Christ. Every act of fellowship with Christ here, is a step Heaven-ward or home-ward to our Fathers house. This will make us sing in the wayes of the Lord while we live, and go triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Heaven when we dye. Those that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:180407:195"/> live in communion with Christ may dye with great confidence (and strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation) that their departure hence shall be an entrance into the joy of their Master, and say at death, as that holy man of God did,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preston.</hi>
                     </note> I shall now change my place but not my company; for they live near to Heaven here, upon the confines of Eternity; even at Heaven-gate: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to dye will be to them but one step, <hi>scil.</hi> from Earth to Heaven; or out of communion with Christ here below in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immediate and full fruition of Christ above.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For sweetness: To live in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Christ, is to lye in a bed of aromatical Spices; of Roses and sweet flowers, or Towers of perfumes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.13. See the Margent.</p>
                  <p>To suck a honey-comb; to eat fat things full of marrow, and to drink Wine on the Lees well refined, spiced Wine; at which feast the soul may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it self in fatness and in sweetness. This is to have a pleasant Nosegay, a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Pomander of love, or a Bundle of Myrrh, or a Sweet-Bagg laid between our breasts; which sends up a most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable scent, to refresh our souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:180407:196"/> with Christs delectable sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. A bundle of myrrh, that is, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of spiritual comforts and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me, saith the spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.13. he shall lye all night betwixt my breasts.</p>
                  <p>To have communion with Christ, is to have Christ as a cluster of Camphire or of Redemption (as the word imports) to us by his death: the sweetness whereof is resembled by a cluster (which is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny berries compacted together) of the sweet Cypress,<note place="margin">Ainsworth.</note> as some render that place, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.14. Christs Redemption is a cluster of sweet smelling savour to our souls, Aromatical, Medicinal and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</p>
                  <p>Hence Christs expressions of love and kindness in communion to our souls, are very fragrant and odoriferous to the smell, very sweet and pleasant, to the taste, or to the spiritual senses, of our souls: as appears by the plenty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of those things to which they are compared upon this account, in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Our Graces and obedience (and the fruits and effects thereof) in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:180407:196"/> of our communion with Christ, are the like to Christ, as appears by the comparisons thereof in the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> II. God the Father calls us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. our Lord, that we may have fellowship with the Father in the Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. For the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10, 11. and the Father and the Son are one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30.</p>
                  <p>Christ is the middle Person, or Mean and Mediator of all society and converse between the Father and us. But out of Christ he hides himself from us, and is a consuming fire to us. Now by fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Christ we may have fellowship with the Father in six particulars,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the manifestation of himself, and of his mind and will, counsels and secrets to us; for God the Father shews himself to us (his beauty and excellency) in his Son, and the Glory of the Father shines in the face of Jesus Christ, and he gives us the light of the knowledge thereof in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and he reveals his will and secrets to us in and by his Son Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the reconciliation of himself to

                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note>3. In his complacency with us, for the Father is well-pleased in his beloved Son Christ, and with all that live in union and communion with him.</p>
                  <p>And in his acceptance of us; for he hath made us to be freely and graciously accepted in his beloved Son Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">Eph. 1.6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both our persons and our Sacrifices, all our duties and performances, as prayers, praises and the rest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As they are performed by us in Christ, to wit, in his strength, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. then our deeds are wrought in God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As they are presented by Christ (and mingled with his odours) to the father for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                  <p>In his returns of answers, rewards and benefits to us in, by or for them all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. And in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence (and comforts of it) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to us as his reconciled ones in
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:180407:197"/> Christ: in which respect Christ is called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that is, God with us; as well as in regard of the union of his divine Nature with our flesh, in one personal subsistance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In his Fatherly affections to us, as his love, delight and compassions in Christ, in whom he hath adopted and regenerated us to be his children: and manifests or actuates all these to us;<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4, 5.</note> that we are his <hi>Jedediahs i. e.</hi> beloved of the Lord: his <hi>Hephzibahs,</hi> that is, his delight is in us.</p>

                  <p>God the Father loveth us with a love of complacency or delight in his Son Christ, because we through Grace do love Jesus Christ and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 23. and believe in him. <hi>The Father himself loveth you</hi> (saith the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.27.) <hi>because ye have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 3.17.</note> The Father rejoyceth over us with joy, to do us good, and joyeth over us with singing (as a father doth over his child, whom he beareth in his bosome, or dandleth on his knee) and rests in his love to us, in his Son Christ.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:180407:198"/>5. In his fatherly blessings both spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal, and in the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good things to us, in and by Christ, as appointed by the Treasury or Fountain of all for us, and the conduit-pipe for conveyance of all to us.</p>
                  <p>Hence, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is said to bless us with all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blessings in heavenly things in Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5. and to supply all our needs by Christ Jesus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In his fatherly corrections of us in Christ as his Sons; <hi>scil.</hi> in Measure and in Mercy; out of his love to us, and for our profit,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.6, 7, 10.</note> to humble us and purge us and make us partakers of his holiness. The father exerciseth the discipline of his Rod towards his children, as they are in Christ, his dearly beloved Son. And in his fatherly consolations of us in and by Christ in all our Tribulations and Sufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>to</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.16, 17. for he is the father of mercies. And in his fatherly forbearance, patience or long-suffering which he exerciseth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus God the Father calleth us unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ, to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:180407:198"/> the end we might have fellowship with him in the Son, and that both,

                        <item>Fatherly on his part. And</item>
                        <item>Filial on our part.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Filial on ours, that we might have fellowship with the Father in the Son by Filial carriage (suitable) on our part towards him, four wayes especially.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By believing in God the father as we do in his Son Christ, and as Christ did in the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By honouring the Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 1.6.</note> and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his glory not our own, as Christ did, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.49, 50. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By obeying the Fathers commands, and doing his will not our own, and those things alwayes, which please him, as his Son Christ did,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.38.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. By submitting patiently to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                  <p>For Christ tells us, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our God and our Father as well as his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. his by nature, and ours by grace; and <hi>Paul</hi> stiles him our Father,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.2, 3.</note> and the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. The Fathers vocation of us unto the fellowship of his Son is a fruit of his election of us unto life eternal; and a certain argument of our perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.9. v. 8.</note> because God is faithfull who hath called us to it, who will continue it to us, or keep us in it, and confirm us unto the end, that we may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Father that hath begun this good work of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between Christ and us, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it untill the day of Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. and then compleat and crown it in glory.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What shall a Christian do, whom God hath called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ, yet cannot injoy communion with him, or the comforts of his presence: not see his face, nor hear his voice, nor feel his love, but
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:180407:199"/> Christ seems to withdraw himself, and carry strangely to the soul, and doth not actuate his Relations (as of a Head and Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) sensibly towards it; as if our Fellowship with him was but a fancy, or imaginary only, not real?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall return an answer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in six Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us search out the cause thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Which is commonly in our selves. Hath not Christ seen some iniquity in us, (unbewailed, unmortified) as whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness and unfaithfulness in our hearts in departing from him (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9.) which have separated between Christ and us, and caused him to hide his face,<note place="margin">Isa. 59.2.</note> and turn away his ear, and be silent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. A Lust indulged will put in a barr between Christ and our souls, which being pulled out by repentance and mortification, a door of fellowship with Christ will be opened to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Christ may estrange himself for a time from our souls, by design for good to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To try and exercise our Graces, the truth and strength of them, as of our faith, love, patience, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether we will love him
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:180407:200"/> when we do not see him; and follow after him, when he seems to go away from us;<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>os. 3.3.</note> and wait for him though he stay long: and not play the Harlot, nor be for another in his absence. The tryal of our Graces procures a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them from Christ; and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of them in our selves, for <hi>habenti dabitur,</hi> to him that hath, <hi>i. e.</hi> useth what he hath, shall more be given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To endear his presence and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him unto us; to make us prize it more highly, and seek it more earnestly (knowing the worth of it by the want of it) keep it more carefully, and hold him fast when we have regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and not let him go, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. and to prepare us for fuller and longer fruition of him.</p>
                  <p>Upon these accounts it may be said that there is a Time for Christ to embrace (the soul) and a Time to refrain from embracing it.<note place="margin">Eccl. 3.5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us get our Right and Title to Christ and to our Relations and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him cleared up to us, and to that end examine our selves in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Have we deliberately and resolvedly
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:180407:200"/> chosen Christ to be our Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and given our free and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be his Members and his Spouse, to become one with him, and fast tyed to him for ever?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do we esteem this Communion with Jesus Christ as the dearest fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in the World, above the comforts and delights of all other Relations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, from some glimpses, tasts or relishes we have had of it; and the sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of it to our spirits; the grain of our disposition lying that way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Are our hearts carryed out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly after intimate fellowship with Christ (in a strong stream of vehement, restless desires) as that without which we can never be satisfied, nor happy, what ever we enjoy besides, as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral relations, riches, honours, pleasures? Can we say with that holy Martyr, None but Christ, None but Christ? that the presence of no creature can supply Christs absence to us? that no love can satisfie the longings, no peace can settle the shakings of our souls, but only Christs?</p>
                  <p>Upon these Grounds we may boldly claim a peculiar Interest in Christ, and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:180407:201"/> call him <hi>Ishi,</hi> my Husband, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.16. and <hi>Roshi</hi> my head, and comfidently expect comfortable communion with him in all the Relations between him and us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us gather grounds out of Gods Word, as rests for our souls to lean on, and security that Christ will renew his fellowship with us, though at present he estrange himself from us, as These three

Ground: the verity, certainty and constancy of his Relations to us, and of ours to him; Christ is as true and real (but spiritual) a Head and Husband to his Church and to every true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the Head is to the Natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.22, 23.</note> or the Man to his married Wife. Therefore our fellowship with Christ upon this account must needs be real, not nominal, notional or imaginary only, according as our Communion with Christ in his righteousness, holiness. Sonship
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:180407:201"/> in his death, resurrection, ascension, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ in the benefits thereof, and in his Offices, are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities, no fancies or conceits.</p>
                  <p>Our communion with him corresponds to our Relations to him.</p>

                  <p>As he is our Husband he is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Very tender hearted, for he really gave himself for his Spouse the Church to dye for her, that she might live;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.26, 27</note> and to shed his heart blood for her to wash her fair.</p>
                  <p>Did he give himself for us, and will he not manifest himself to us? Did he dye for us, and will he not live with us? Did he shed his blood for us, and will he not shed his love abroad in us? Did he come to bring us light, life, peace and joy, and will he go away and leave us dead, dark, sad and troubled?</p>

                  <p n="2">2. God hateth putting away, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.16. between Man and Wife, and Christ hates divorce between himself and his Spouse.</p>

                  <p>The longer Christ defers to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and to satisfie us, he will pay use for forbearance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us fill our mouths with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and plead strenuously with Christ for real and effectual fellowship with him; as these five.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Argument: It is not presumption but obedience in us to desire it, and pursue it: considering,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:180407:204"/>1. That God the Father hath called us unto it (as I shewed before) to seek it and enjoy it; and God who calleth us is faithful, who also will do it, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.24. that is, see it done effectually; and not only begun, but continued even to the end. And considering,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Christ calls us so oft unto him: Now Christ calls of us to come unto him, are calls to communion with him.</p>
                  <p>We may say to our souls in this case, as the Disciples did to <hi>Bartimeus</hi> the Blind Man in Mark 10.49. <hi>Be of good comfort, rise</hi> (go to Christ) <hi>he calleth thee;</hi> and we should do as <hi>Mary</hi> did, who as soon as she heard that Christ her Master was come, and called for her, she arose quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and came unto him, <hi>John</hi> 11.28.</p>
                  <p>To come unto Christ to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, is to do but what we are commanded, and what is our duty: and this we may do boldly, chearfully and confidently; Christ complains when men will not come unto him, <hi>John</hi> 5.40.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Argument: Is not the Lord our Maker and our Redeemer, our Husband; and hath in this regard said unto us, Fear not, ye shall not be ashamed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.4, 5. Will he not live and dwell as an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:180407:204"/> with us? May not Christ call us, in his withdrawings or hidings of himself from us,<note place="margin">Isa. 54.6.</note> as a Woman forsaken (by her Husband) and grieved in Spirit (upon that account) and will he not reunite us again unto himself, as a man his wife, that he had left for a time? And make us a Wife of youth, that is, as dear to him again, as a young Wife to her Husband; Will the Lord cast off his Church or any poor soul, that is, his companion and the Wife of his Covenant, whereof God the Father is a witness, as of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife? <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p>Did he not betroth us unto himself for ever, in loving kindness, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c. Hos.</hi> 2.19, 20. how then can he break his Covenant with us, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake us utterly?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Argument: Is not Christs desire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and his delight in us, even to have fellowship with us?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His desire towards us, his conjugal desire.<note place="margin">Cant. 7.10.</note> It was laid as a Curse upon the Woman, that her desire should be to her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.3</note> But its a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the Spouse, and to every soul espoused unto Christ, that her heavenly Husbands desire is to his Wife; to see
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:180407:205"/> her countenance, and to hear her voice, because sweet is her Voice, and her Countenance is comely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. and he knocketh to come in and sup with her, and she with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 30.20.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the earnestness of Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire towards us to enjoy us wholly and peculiarly to himself, appear by the whole scope of this Song of Songs? Should not our desires then be towards Christ to have communion with him, and will not Christ satisfie them fully?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is not Christs delight in us? for he saith to his Spouse, How fair and how pleasant art thou, O Love, for delights? <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.6. or in delights? One saith, it is an allusion to the Marriage-bed, which is the delights of the Bridegroom and Bride; This Marriage-bed is (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) the publick Worship of God in the Congregation of the Church: this is the bed of Love, where Christ embraceth the souls of his people, and casteth into their hearts the immortal seeds of his Word and Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. and the Church conceiveth and bringeth forth fruits unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ainsworth.</note>Some think this to be the Reason why the King (Jesus) is held in the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:180407:205"/> in the former Verse, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 7.5.) because he was delighted, and as it were ravished with her heavenly graces, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9, 10. (as Kings are held in their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of pleasure) that he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part wholly from her.</p>
                  <p>Hath not Christ promised to rejoyce over us, as the Bridegroom doth over the Bride, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.5. That is, to take as much pleasure and delight in us, and in fellowship with us, as such are wont to take, the one in the other? and will he not cause our souls to rejoyce in him, and in communion with him, by his Manifestations, Communications and Consolations dispensed to us therein?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Argument: Doth not the Lord bid us return, (as he did <hi>Israel</hi> of old) after we have backslidden and gone astray from him, and carried ill towards him, upon this account, because he is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.1, 4, 5, 14. Which assures us that he will receive us unto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and fellowship again. May we not retort this, or plead the same for our selves before the Lord, wilt not thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to us (after thou hast gone away and tarried long from us) because we are married to thee?</p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:180407:206"/>
                  <p>Hath not the Lord promised to be with us, while we are with him, and not to forsake us, so long as we do not forsake him? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. May we not say, behold Lord, is it not the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire, care, resolution and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our souls to keep close to Christ? to pursue after thee and wait for thee? and to carry Wife-like, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, loyally and faithfully towards thee, even in thy absence from us? and wilt thou leave us and forsake us, when we do not, or desire not to leave thee?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Argument: Put Christ in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our many Prayers, Tears, Sighs, Groans, wherewith we have lamented after him, sought him sorrowing, and wrestled hard with him (some of us many years) for his gracious returns to us, or communion with him,<note place="margin">Hos. 12.4.</note> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with the Angel for a blessing.</p>
                  <p>May we not say with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> O Lord, remember now how we have walked before thee in truth, in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after thee and waiting for thee,<note place="margin">2 King. 20.3.</note> and how we have wept sometimes with a great weeping, to enjoy thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 45.19.</note>Didst thou ever say to thy servants, seek ye me in vain? Dost thou set them
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:180407:206"/> on longing after thee,<note place="margin">Jer. 15.18.</note> to disappoint their expectations? wilt thou be unto them as waters that fail? which are dryed up in the heat of Summer, when men have most need of them, as <hi>Job</hi>'s friends were to him, <hi>Job</hi> 6.15.</p>
                  <p>Put him in mind frequently of his promises, which ingage him to renew his fellowship with us. Say with <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119.49.</note> Remember thy Word unto thy servant upon which thou hast caused me to trust.</p>
                  <p>God permits us (yea bids us) put him in remembrance:<note place="margin">Isa. 43.26.</note> he gives us liberty to plead our own cause with him; and if we have any thing to say for our selves (as in this case of having communion with Christ) to speak it out freely.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us recollect former experience (both our own and others) of Christs various dealings in this respect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our own Experiences, That though Christ hath for a season gone away from us and is not nigh to us as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but hid his face, and to our sense left our souls desolate or destitute of the quickning, refreshing influences of his presence, and we have walked in darkness and seen no light, yet he hath returned
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:180407:207"/> again to us, and visited our souls with gracious manifestations, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of himself to us, with smiles and shines.</p>
                  <p>Now what Christ hath done, he will do to us. Christ is and will be the same for ever, that ever he was. Let us call to remembrance our songs (which God gave us formerly) in the night, as the Psalmist did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.6. and the loving kindness he commanded and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us in the day time, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.8. and remember Christs love (which we have formerly tasted) more than Wine; as the spouse did, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. Former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences are refreshing cordials in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent desertions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us consult and consider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods dealings with others in this case: as with <hi>Job,</hi> who went mourning without the Sun, <hi>chap.</hi> 30.28. but afterwards this Sun appeared in some cloud to him, and his eye saw God, that is, a visible demonstration of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or a glimpse of Glory, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himself, and his will towards him, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.5, 6. this was a special favour. And with <hi>David,</hi> from whom God hid his face, and he was troubled, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:180407:207"/> he made him full of joy with the light of his countenance: and with the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.1. yea with his dear Son <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> who experienced (as to his sense) very dark and deep desertions from his Father at his Passion; which caused him to sweat drops of blood in his Agony, and on the Cross to cry out, My God, My God, Why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me! But after his resurrection he received him up into Glory, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Thus Christ carryed it towards his Spouse, though she opened to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.6.</note> he sometimes withdrew himself and was gone, and she sought him but found him not, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2. but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards she found him, whom her soul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and held him and would not let him go, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. sometimes Christ leads her into a Wilderness, a dry and thirsty land, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.5. and sometimes he brings her into his chambers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. And towards his Disciples from whom he went away, and they therefore had sorrow for a little while, but afterwards he did see them again, and their hearts rejoyced, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 16.16, 20, 22.</p>
                  <p>If these precious servants of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:180407:208"/> sometimes such interruptings of their communion with God and Christ, such cloudings of Gods face towards them, and Eclypses of their joy (yea Christ himself did the like from his Father) what have we deserved, or what may we expect in this kind?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us recount how comfortable and joyfull, sweet and welcome will Christ's returns to our souls be, and the renewings of his fellowship with us, after his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and hidings or estrangings of himself from us, even as light after darkness, as the rising of the Sun is to all living creatures.</p>
                  <p>As the Morning is after a dark, sad, weary Night, to them that have kept watch or layn in pain.</p>
                  <p>As Rain and Dew are after Drought.</p>
                  <p>As a calm is after a storm by Land or Sea.</p>
                  <p>Or as clear shining after rain; or as fair weather after foul; as the coming of the Bridegroom, or the return of a Husband, a Wife, a Son, or dear Friend, that hath been long absent or far distant, as from a long journey, or out of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countrey: or as the face of a friend, whom we have not seen of a long time.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:180407:208"/> How was <hi>Paul</hi> refreshed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Titus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.6.</note> as the coming of a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian with healing Medicines and Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to a sick Patient, so is Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a soul that is sick of sin in it self, and of self; or sick of love to Christ.</p>
                  <p>As joyfull as life from the dead, or the receiving of some related to us, whom we supposed had been dead, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his Son <hi>Joseph, Gen.</hi> 45.28. and the Father did his prodigal Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.24. as liberty from restraint or bondage. As good News from a far Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Christs return is a reviving, and is comforting and quickning to a soul dead in its own sense; and an inlarging to a straitned or imprisoned soul.</p>
                  <p>God hath given us all these under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which should incourage us to seek and expect daily the performance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from him, but with <hi>an Eye to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> annexed.</p>
                  <p>As that God will be a Sun to us and will enlighten our darkness, but we must endeavour to <hi>walk uprightly</hi> that Christ the Sun of righteousness shall arise unto us with healing under his wings,<note place="margin">Psa. 84.11. &amp; 18 25, 28.</note> but we should <hi>desire to fear his Name,</hi> Mal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>That his going forth is prepared as the Morning, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.3. <hi>scil.</hi> that God is as ready to come unto us, as the day is to dawn, or the morning is to look forth; but we must <hi>follow on to know the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and wait for him more than they that watch for the morning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 6.3.</note>That he will come unto us as the rain, as the former and latter rain unto the Earth;<note place="margin">Psa. 143.6.</note> but our Souls must <hi>thirst after him</hi> as a thirsty Land.</p>
                  <p>And he will be as the dew unto <hi>Israel, Hos.</hi> 14.5. but <hi>Israel</hi> must <hi>return unto the Lord.</hi> v. 1. and take with them words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> v. 2. and say, <hi>Ashur</hi> shall not save us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> v. 3.</p>
